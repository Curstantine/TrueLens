      "original_title": "Sampanthan, stature diminished by links to LTTE, is no more",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Sampanthan could never overlook the ethnic divisions that have plagued Sri Lanka for decades – before, during and after the war",
        "Sampanthan, one among the few TNA leaders who Western diplomats in Colombo continued to respect despite his political predicament, tried to come on to his own after the LTTE was militarily crushed. Now minus the armed campaign to break up Sri Lanka, the TNA leader made some bold statements, making it clear that he wanted to be a part of the island nation. A section of the TNA, which fragmented over the years, sided with him. After the war, he played a major role in highlighting internationally the horrific price the ordinary Tamils had to pay in Sri Lanka simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time",
        "Sri Lankan Tamil political leader Rajavarothiyam Sampanthan, who died on 30 June at age 91, emerged as the most prominent Tamil face in the island nation after the decimation of the Tamil Tigers. But his later moderate voice and readiness to accept a united Sri Lanka were forever marred by the long years he paid homage to the LTTE’s nihilist politics, seriously jeopardising a long and tumultuous political career that began in the 1960s.",
        "Elected for the first time to the Sri Lankan Parliament in 1977 as a front-ranking member of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), then the most popular party in the Tamil community, Sampanthan saw several ups and downs before becoming the main opposition leader in Parliament in 2015. This was six years after the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran, founder leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sampanthan held the coveted post, only the second Tamil to do so, for three years.",
        "But it was in 2001 when he, as the senior most Tamil politician, came to head the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a grouping of diverse political parties including some which once were part of the armed campaign to carve out an independent Tamil Eelam. But those who thought that the TNA would probably be to the LTTE what the Sinn Fein was to the Irish Republican Party (IRA) were soon disappointed.",
        "The LTTE was then at the peak of its glory and was widely seen, including by sections of the Sri Lankan military, as an armed force which could never be crushed. Indeed, the next year, in 2002, a desperate Colombo signed with the LTTE a ceasefire agreement as part of an international peace process driven by Norway. Unlike the IRA, the LTTE did not want anyone, Tamil politicians sympathetic to it included, to share the political limelight.",
        "In the process, the TNA surrendered wholesale to the LTTE, formally declaring the Tamil Tigers as the sole representative of the Tamil community. It did not matter that men like Sampanthan were in politics when Prabhakaran was still a teenager and had entered Parliament when the LTTE chief was a virtual nobody. In that instant, the TNA became a second-class appendage to the LTTE, losing respect not only among the mass of the Tamil people but also in Colombo as well as internationally. Country after country came to view the TNA as a pitiable extension of the LTTE, which New Delhi banned in 1992, a year after a suicide bomber blew up former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
        "The 2002 truce collapsed within years, triggering the last and the bloodiest rounds of Eelam War, resulting in the wholesale destruction in 2009 of the LTTE and its entire leadership besides the surrender by thousands of Tamil Tiger fighters.",
        "From 2001 to 2009, the TNA led by Sampanthan, who in earlier times spent long years in Tamil Nadu, kept a steady chant against the military excesses in Sri Lanka and highlighted the suffering of the Tamil civilians in the war. But it kept mum on the many excesses of the LTTE including its decision not to allow tens of thousands of ordinary Tamils, women and children included, to leave its zone in northern Sri Lanka even as the military menacingly advanced. In the eventuality, tens of thousands of civilians died in the end stages of the 25-year-long conflict.",
        "Whatever may have been Sampanthan’s intentions, many who had known him could not understand how he could bow to the LTTE, fully knowing that it cold-bloodedly assassinated his own leader, A. Amirthalingam, and a colleague, V. Yogeswaran. Both men were stalwarts of the moderate TULF, Sampanthan’s party. Not just this. The LTTE often treated Sampanthan shabbily without caring for his age as well as political seniority.",
        "No wonder, Sampanthan sounded often confused as he appeared to be travelling in two boats at the same time. He could not justify Amirthalingam’s cowardly killing yet he would not denounce it beyond a point; he was not comfortable with the LTTE but had to support it and its leader Prabhakaran; he wanted to be a part of Sri Lanka’s mainstream politics but could not denounce the Tamil separatist campaign; he would have been happy with a political end to the Tamil grievances but he could not tell that to the Tamil Tigers. Without his wanting it, Sampanthan ended up being a prisoner of the negative politics the LTTE hoisted on the Tamils, making everyone in the minority community its virtual prisoner; the dissenters were dubbed “traitors” and done to death.",
        "Sampanthan, one among the few TNA leaders who Western diplomats in Colombo continued to respect despite his political predicament, tried to come on to his own after the LTTE was militarily crushed. Now minus the armed campaign to break up Sri Lanka, the TNA leader made some bold statements, making it clear that he wanted to be a part of the island nation. A section of the TNA, which fragmented over the years, sided with him. After the war, he played a major role in highlighting internationally the horrific price the ordinary Tamils had to pay in Sri Lanka simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
        "The normally suave Sampanthan once lost his cool with a Tamil journalist over the Sri Lankan national flag, which sections of Tamils do not accept. Sampanthan made it clear that he very much respected the flag and that it was his duty as a mainstream politician to respect it. “I belong to Sri Lanka. Not to any other country,” he thundered. Sampanthan was combative and accused the journalist of raising needless questions simply to keep the country divided on ethnic lines.",
        "The contradictions never deserted him even as he lay ill in Colombo. Amid a looming Presidential election in Sri Lanka, Tamil political parties are divided on what to do: support one of the main Sinhalese presidential candidates or put up a Tamil candidate for whatever the worth or boycott the elections, like in 2005. Sampanthan was reportedly in favour of backing incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe, the man who long years ago signed a peace pact with the LTTE. But before he could announce a decision, Sampanthan passed away, marking the end of an era in Sri Lanka’s Tamil politics",
        "Yet, Sampanthan could never overlook the ethnic divisions that have plagued Sri Lanka for decades – before, during and after the war. Anura Dissanayake, leader of the leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), recently told an audience in London that Sampanthan one day clasped his hands in Parliament and said in visible despair: “I want to shout loudly that I am a Sri Lankan. But I am not able to do it because we (Tamils) are not treated fairly.”",

By addressing the issue at its source, this project strives to create a positive impact on the environment and remove plastic waste before it enters the ocean.",

Alongside the installation of the Ocean Strainer, volunteers representing Cargills, MAS, and the Interact Club of Colombo undertook the task of cleaning the surrounding area to the lake, including the walking path.",

      "original_title": "Jan 1974  World Tamil Conference in Jaffna, Poiice Attack on Public and Civilian Deaths .",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "A significant event in the post-independence history of the Sri Lankan Tamils took place fifty years ago on 10 January 1974 in Jaffna. A joyful cultural celebration was marred by the Sri Lankan Police unleashing violence against  Tamil civilans. Ecstasy turned into agony when  the panic-stricken  people ran helter – skelter for safety.  Seven persons died of electrocution  when  electric wires were dislodged  by  Police firing in the air. Another died of a heart attack in the melee. The fiftieth death anniversary of the tragic victims was  commemorated  in Jaffna on Wednesday.(Jan 10).",
        "This columnist then a 19 year old lived in Jaffna and attended the research conference related events. The course of events are yet embedded in memory. What happened then was this.",
        "The fourth world  Tamil Research Conference  of the International Association of Tamil Research(IATR)  was held in Jaffna from  January 3rd to 9th 1974.. The conference attended by  several Internationally reputed Tamil scholars  was purely academic and restricted to a selected audience. However a cultural event was held on Jan 10 for a mass audience with the participation of some of the international Tamil scholars.  The huge crowdSeveral awards were handed out at the event. estimated between 10 to 15,000 spilled over into some streets and roads also.",
        "A platform had been erected in the precincts of Veerasingham hall where the conference had taken place. The crowds attending the event were within Vee0rasingham hall premises and the Jaffna esplanade. The road between the hall and esplanade was full of people. Initially the Police cooperated fully with the organizers and even re-directed traffic along other roads to divert vehicles away from the crowds..  The Police also ensured proper parking of vehicles. The Policemen on duty at the event had no problems with the people and even engaged in amiable conversation with them.",
        "The atmosphere changed  drastically when a Police contingent  led by the then Assistant Superintendent of Polce (ASP) Chandrasekera tried to proceed through the middle of the crowd and asked people  through a hailer to move aside and let the Police vehicles pass. The people at the outer edges of the crowd did so and the vehicles proceeded inward slowly. Since the crowd in the middle was dense, the people could not move away and the Police vehicles got stuck. Some of the youngsters in the crowd began hooting and jeering.",
        "ASP Chandrasekera a former bodyguard to the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike , then ordered his men to crack down forcefully although the Police had not sustained any damage or  faced any real danger.",
        "ASP Chandrasekera tried to justify his action  later   at the Magisterial inquiry by stating that stones were thrown at the Police. He claimed that two Policemen were injured and a vehicle damaged  by the stone throwing. The ASP also said that he was proceeding to the venue because of information that an Indian national and political activist from Tamil Nadu was addressing the meeting though he was not permitted to do so. The person in question was R.Janarthanam the president of the “Ulagath Thamizhar Ilaingar Paeravai” (World Tamil Youth Federation)",
        "Acting under the ASP’s orders  the Policemen numbering over  40 first began firing tear gas cannisters. This was  followed  by helmet wearing cops  baton charging the crowd. The terrified people began  scattering and running in all directions seeking safety. Pandemonium erupted when the Police  began using firearms by firing in the air.",
        "The time was past 8 PM and additional electricity had been obtained through a generator to enhance  illumination. When a Policeman fired upwards, some bullets hit the electric wires and  loosened them . The overhead  wires fell on an iron railing separating the Veerasingham hall and the road. As a result several people got electrocuted. Seven died. Apart from the deaths, over 50 people were injured in the stampede.",
        "In addition to the seven electrocuted , there was another casualty too on that night. This was a well 0knownschool master who had died of a heart attack while fleeing the Police attack. There had also been two more deaths by electrocution the previous day. A parade  with floats   or vehicles with exhibits mounted on a platform was held on Jan 9th in Jaffna. One of the floats was miniature replica  of “Annapoorani” the Valvettithurai built schooner that  was sailed to the USA. One of the sails  struck overhead wires resulting in two men being electrocuted to death. Thus ten persons had died in incidents relating to the Jaffna conference.",
        "Police unleashing violence against  civilans assembled peacefully at a cultural event shocked the people of Jaffna in particular and the Tamils in general. It was compared by some to the Jalianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 in Punjab, India.  Hundreds were killed  when  Gen. Dyer of the British army ordered his troops to fire  on a civilan gathering. “Will the Sinhala majority state not allow Tamils to  even participate in a cultural event in their cultural capital, Jaffna” was the  question in many Tamil “hearts and minds”then.",
        "The overwhelming Tamil mood was morose and resentful. While the Police attack was deplorable and by itself incurred the people’s wrath, there were two important reasons for the collective sense of hurt and grief felt by the Tamil people then.",
        "The first was that the Research conference had been held in Jaffna after a bitter struggle. Tamil politicians, academics, writers and artistes aligned with or sympathetic to the then United Front Government of Prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike wanted  the IATR conference to be held in Colombo. Another section of the Tamil people wanted it in Jaffna. Finally the conference was held in Jaffna despite the obstructionist tactics of the Govt and their supporters. Jaffna in its entirety was in a festive mood then Homage paid by foreign scholars to their mother tongue made all Tamils happy and proud. The unnecessary violence unleashed marred the joyful mood and caused anger and sadness.",
        "The second reason was that the ruling Government showed no remorse or regret for the attack or the loss of life. Furthermore the Govt turned a deaf ear to requests that the Govt should set up a commission of inquiry to probe the incident. The matter was raised in Parliament too but there was only a deafening silence.  The magisterial inquiry held by Jaffna magistrate K.Palakidnar had ruled that the deaths were due to” accidental electrocution “. But prevailing Tamil public opinion was for a commission of inquiry to probe the conduct of the Police.",
        "What must be realised is that the impact of an incident like this was tremendous five decades ago. It was like a first of its kind incident. Subsequently as  the ethnic issue escalated into unbridled violence and open war, the Tamils experienced massacres of  far greater proportion. But at that time seven persons dying as a result of Police violence had a profound effect on the Tamil psyche.",
        "It was a crucial factor in strengthening the secessionist tendency among Tamils. It is noteworthy that former Leader of the Opposition and Tamil  United Liberation Front(TULF) leader Appapillai  Amirthalingam  when testifying before the Sansoni Commission observed thus – “the refusal of the government to appoint a Presidential Commission to inquire into the seven deaths and the conduct of the Police which led to those deaths, was a prime cause of the demand for a separate state.”",
        "Tamils in Sri Lanka had looked forward to the  IATR World Tamil research conference being held in Jaffna. Tamils are very proud of their ancient language and literature. Tamil is recognized as a classical language. A unique feature of the  affectionate regard Tamils have for their language is the reference to “Thamizh Thaai”  meaning mother Tamil. Tamils personify their mother tongue as their  mother  or mother Tamil. Hence an international Tamil conference being held in Jaffna was  most welcome. In a land where their language had been deprived of official language status  and where  they had been systematically discriminated  against, the honour and prestige of an international conference on Tamil in Jaffna  was something they eagerly anticipated.",
        "Moreover Jaffna had a special link or connection with the IATR and the convening of Tamil research conferences. The IATR and Tamil research conferences was a brainchild of a distinguished Tamil from Jaffna. Rev Fr Xavier Stanislaus Thaninayagam known respectfully as “Thaninayagam Adigal” was an eminent Catholic Clergyman and renowned linguistic scholar.",
        "Fr. Thaninayagam loved and revered the Tamil language. He  taught at many universities and also  lectured about the Tamil language, culture and literature globally visiting many countries. Thaninayagam Adigal also edited a quarterly journal called “Tamil Culture” specializing in Tamil studies.",
        "Fr Thaninayagam served as  Dean of the faculty  of arts and head of the Indian studies department  at the University of Malaya (UM) at Kuala Lumpur from 1961 to 1966. During this time, Fr. Thaninayagam  participated at the 1964  Orient Scholars Conference in New Delhi. He along with two others convened a meeting of Tamil scholars attending the conference in New Delhi. Thaninayagam proposed the setting up of a  body for  Tamil studies and research. Thaninayagam’s brainchild became a reality in the form of the International Association for Tamil research.(IATR) in New Delhi.",
        "Xavier Thaninayagam followed through by organizing the first world Tamil research conference under the auspices of the IATR  in  April 1966. It was held at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.  The conference was ceremonially declared open by the Malaysian Prime minister of that time Tunku Abdul Rahman.

        "The second IATR World Conference was held in the  Indian city of Madras (Now Chennai) in January 1968. It was declared open by the Indian President of that time Dr.Zakir Husain who was himself a leading educationist.  163 research papers were submitted.The strongly Tamil nationalist Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) ruled the Tamil Nadu state then.",
        "The DNK chief minister CN Annadura’s Govt i, popularised  the academic  conference  by organizing  entertaining  mass -oriented events simultaneously. Apart from a number of cultural events a  gigantic procession followed by a mass meeting at Marina beach was held. The icing on the cake was the erection of ten statues  of Tamil scholars, poets and writers.",
        "The third  IATR  World Tamil Conference was held in Paris in July 1970. Dr.Malcolm Adiseshiah a Tamil hailing from Vellore in Tamil Nadu was  then the deputy director-general of UNESCO. Fr. Thaninayagam in tandem with Dr.Adiseshiah organized theconference in France. It was purely an academic affair. The conference was opened by the  then French minister of culture Edmond Michelet. A total of 16 research papers were submitted. The then  chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Muthuvel Karunanidhi attended the conference. In Paris.",
        "From inception , the IATR research conferences were held every two years. The fourth conference was scheduled to be held in 1972 and Sri Lanka was to be the venue. The Sirimavo Bandaranaike led  Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)  majority government was not receptive to the idea. It was said  that the  Tamil research conference would radicalise Tamil  sentiments in Sri Lanka. It was also said that the leading Sri Lankan Tamil political party . the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) could politicise the event. Thuogh the Leftist Lanka Sama Samaja Party(LSSP) and Communist Party(CP) were constituents of the Government, they did not enlighten their senior partner.",
        "The only Tamil minister in the UF Government was Chelliah Kumarasuriar, an engineer,  who held the post and telecommunications ministry portfolio.He had been first appointed Senator and after the abolition of the Senate made  an appointed MP. A group of non -political Tamil academics and professionals  interacted with Kumarasuriar and got his support to conduct the Conference in Sri Lanka. Kumarasuriar in turn  obtained the Government’s green light to hold the conference on the condition that it should only be of an academic nature devoid of politics.",
        "The conference which should have been held in 1972 was not held that year. Finally it was  scheduled for January 1974.",
        "A  committee was set up to organize the conference in Sri Lanka. It was widely representative and consisted of academics, professionals, artistes, writer and journalists. It was supposedly non -political and mandated to organize the conference only.",
        "However the organizing committee was soon divided internally. A bloc or group supportive of Kumarasuriar emerged. The  primary bone of contention was the venue. Kumarasuriar and his group wanted it to be held in Colombo. The others with the tacit support of the ITAK wanted to  be held in Jaffna.",
        "China’s gift to Sri Lanka the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) had been opened in  Colombo. Kumarasuriar’s group wanted the Tamil conference to be held at the BMICH with the then President (Non -executive) William Gopallawa declaring it open.  They argued that  it was  appropriate to hold the conference n the capital city Colombo. The first and third conferences were held in the Malaysian capital Kula Lumpur and French capital  Paris, it was pointed out.",
        "The others did not agree. They said the Tamil Conference should be held in the largest Tamil city in Sri Lanka -Jaffna. Moreover Jaffna was deemed the cultural capital of Sri Lankan tamils. It was also pointed out that the second conference was held in the Tamil Nadu capital Madras and not New Delhi the Indian capital. After a long tussle the Pro-Jaffna sections in the Committee won the day",
        "The Organizing committee broke up and several resigned or were made to quit. Lake House Journalist T. Sabaratnam working for “Thinakaran” was a member of the organizing committee. He voted for Jaffna as the venue. A furious Kumarasuriar exerted pressure on the ANCL management and forced Sabaratnam to resign from the committee. Retired Supreme Court  Judge H.W. Thambiah was the committee head. He too resigned.",
        "A re-constituted organizing committee was set up with Prof. Vithianandan as President.",
        "Vithianandan had been the premier  force in getting the Conference to be held in Jaffna. The joint secretaries were Dr.Kopan Mahadeva and architect VS Thurairajah. A secretariat was set up in Main street,Jaffna to organize the conference. Fr. Thaninayagam was the Committee patron and adviser. The committee guaranteed that the conference would be purely academic and would not be politicised.",
        "The Govt was not happy about the conference being held in Jaffna and was non -cooperative.  Since the IATR Conference in Madras had been utilised by the ruling DMK to earn political kudos, it was feared that the ITAK would do so in Jaffna. Kumarasuriar and his minions especially the “Mutpoakku Ezhuthhaalar Sanfam”(Progressive Writers association ) and some Tamil academics were hostile. It was in this environment that the 4th IATR World Tamil Research Conference was held in Jaffna. What happened thereafter would be related in the second part of this article.",

        "What is the future of Tamil nationalist politics in Sri Lanka? This question, which has arisen in the aftermath of the recent Parliamentary Elections, should not be viewed simply in terms of the future electoral prospects of Tamil parties. It is a question related to the anxiety regarding the prospects for the fulfillment of the legitimate political aspirations of the Tamil people.",
        "The Tamil nationalist political parties that have represented the Tamil people of the north and east in Parliament for more than 15 years since the end of the civil war have suffered a major setback in this Parliamentary Election.",
        "It seems difficult to expect that these parties, which have never shown any moral interest in introspecting on the reasons why the past struggles for the political rights of the Tamil people have not been fruitful, will look back and correct their political path after this defeat.",
        "As a result of the Tamil nationalist parties splitting and contesting elections as different factions, the parliamentary representation of Tamils ​​from the north and east has been weakened even more than before. Tamil politicians had ignored the warnings given in advance in this regard.",
        "The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), which had six seats in the last Parliament, cannot be complacent with winning eight seats this time as an increase in its popular support. The ITAK should view its electoral performance against the backdrop of the fact that a Sinhala-dominated national party has won more seats in all five electoral districts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces for the first time in Sri Lanka’s electoral history.",
        "The National People’s Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won a resounding victory in the Tamil areas without making any promises about a substantive solution to the important issues pressing the Tamil people, including the national ethnic issue.",
        "Politicians and observers, like blind men feeling an elephant, are making various comments about this victory. The leaders of the NPP interpret the support given to them by the Tamil people as a rejection of Tamil communal politics, i.e. Tamil nationalism and they are trying to draw a parallel to the defeat suffered by some Sinhalese Buddhist hardline politicians at the elections, which is being portrayed as a defeat of Sinhalese communalism.",
        "At the same time, some Tamil politicians are comparing the votes received by all Tamil parties in the north and east with votes received by the NPP and are making an argument that the Tamil people have not rejected Tamil nationalism.",
        "When it comes to elections, the seats they win are what matter. There is no point in trying to establish that Tamil nationalist sentiment is alive among the people by adding up the total number of votes of the parties that lost the elections.",
        "Just as the electoral defeat of certain politicians in the south cannot be said to be a defeat of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism, the defeat of Tamil nationalist parties in the north and east also cannot be described as a defeat of Tamil nationalism.",
        "President Dissanayake, who has vowed in his policy statement to the new Parliament that he will never allow politics of racism and religious extremism to reappear in Sri Lanka, will never be able to achieve that goal without finding solutions to the long-standing problems that have been created by the same racism.",
        "It can never be said that the Tamil people voted for the NPP accepting its positions on the national ethnic issue. Likewise, the failure of the Tamil parties cannot be interpreted as a sign that the Tamil people are ready to join the national political stream, abandoning their long-standing key demands regarding their legitimate political aspirations.",
        "Looking at the pattern of people voting for the NPP from Point Pedro in the north to Dondra in the south, it is understandable that the Tamils, like the Sinhalese, were waiting for an opportunity to reject the traditional political parties.",
        "The Tamil people had no choice but to turn to the NPP because there was no proper political force among them that could lead them on a pragmatic and prudent political path suitable to the present domestic and global political climate.",
        "At the same time, another reason for the hatred towards Tamil politicians is that they do not think and act in a manner that is in line with the demands of the situation and simply chant emotional Tamil nationalist slogans instead of paying attention to the various livelihood problems faced by the war-affected Tamil people.",
        "There are Tamil politicians who said that when the people’s uprising broke out in south Sri Lanka two-and-a-half years ago amidst an unprecedented economic downturn, it was not a problem for the Tamil people. It was also seen that certain Tamil politicians spoke in Parliament that if the wealthy among the Tamil diaspora were allowed to invest freely in Sri Lanka, there would be no room for economic problems.",
        "Tamil politicians could not understand the recent change in thinking among their people. People directly told Tamil politicians in many places in the north that they would vote for the President’s party at the Parliamentary Elections. But, as usual, these politicians had remained lukewarm, hoping that the Tamils would vote for Tamil parties.",
        "In the early stages of the campaign, the Tamil parties did not understand the danger they were in. It was only in the final stages that they realised the depth of the situation and launched fierce attacks on the NPP. Before that, not only other Tamil parties but also those within the ITAK  were in an overdrive in campaigning to defeat former Member of Parliament (MP) M.A. Sumanthiran in order to “save Tamil nationalism” from “danger”.",
        "Despite Tamil politicians repeatedly pointing out during the campaign that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the flagship party of the NPP, had adopted policies and carried out actions that were against the political aspirations of the Tamil people in the past, they were unable to win the people over to their side considerably.",
        "It seems that the Tamil politicians think that the Tamil people were angry with them and supported the NPP only because they had contested the elections in different factions. Judging by the comments they have been making over the past few days, it seems they believe that if they come forward to unite again, the people will give them overwhelming support like before.",
        "A few days ago, Tamil National People’s Front (TNPF) Leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam announced that he was ready to work with other Tamil parties based on the political settlement proposals put forward by the now defunct Tamil People’s Council (Tamil Makkal Peravai), a formation of Tamil civil society organisations and political parties formed 10 years ago. However, other Tamil parties have not yet responded to his overture.",
        "Similarly, ITAK Parliamentary Group Leader Sivagnanam Shritharan also announced that he was ready to reunite and work with other parties as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). That too has not been answered. A few other politicians have also spoken about the need for reunification.",
        "Even if the same leaders who were responsible for the current deterioration of the Tamil polity by deliberately missing the opportunity to build the TNA, which had been in existence for more than two decades and served as a powerful political movement that united the Tamil people of the north and east in the period following the end of the civil war, were to come forward to unite again, it is doubtful whether they will be able to rebuild trust among the Tamil people.",
        "The Tamil people will certainly view any attempt to unite the parties after the election defeat with suspicion. What explanation will the Tamil politicians present to the people for showing a renewed interest in unity? The main reason for the divisions that occurred among the Tamil parties lay in the strategies of contesting elections rather than differences in policy.",
        "Based on experiences so far, there will be nothing more futile than expecting unity or a unified approach among the Tamil political parties. Beyond differences in policy, egoism and personality rivalries between the leaders have been the main factors in the decline of Tamil politics for a long time.",
        "The leaders of armed Tamil extremist movements, who were several steps ahead of moderate political leaders in this regard, committed fratricide on a large scale. Such a perverse trend continues even now in different forms.",
        "Above all, today’s Tamil politicians should reflect on whether the policies and approaches they have adopted over the past 15 years have helped move even an inch forward in the direction of finding a political solution to the ethnic problem.",
        "Although it is the Government’s responsibility to provide a political solution, Tamil politicians should think deeply about whether their actions so far have given the Tamil people a little hope that they will have a future if they continue to live in their land.",
        "If Tamil nationalism is to be preserved, the territory must be preserved. For that, people must live in that territory. No nationalism can be preserved without people and land.",
        "A significant section of the Tamil population ​​will not want to continue living there if they do not believe that they and their future generations will have a better future if they continue to live in the north and east. A door-to-door survey by politicians would help them know how many Tamils ​​are willing to migrate to North America or Western Europe. What is there to save nationalism in a land without people?",
        "An important question is whether the Tamil politicians currently elected to Parliament will change their previous tendencies and act together after the lesson taught by the people at the elections.",
        "It is learnt that TNPF Leader Ponnambalam and the ITAK parliamentary group, who met Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha separately after the elections, emphasised the need for India to apply pressure on the new Government in Sri Lanka on the ethnic issue. They must realise that without a strong political movement among the Tamils, their demands will not be heeded and the international community will not be likely to care.",
        "The Tamil parties should also consider how effective the approaches they have adopted so far, based on the hope that international powers, including India, will put pressure on Sri Lanka, have been. They should also explore the possibilities of dealing with the new Government differently, instead of the same approaches they adopted with previous governments.",
        "With the NPP Government announcing that it will bring in a new constitution, a great responsibility awaits Tamil parliamentarians. If they fail to act with foresight and political wisdom to meet the demands of the situation, Tamils will ultimately be left as a mass of people who will not have gained anything even after unimaginable sacrifices in their decades-long struggle.",
        "Finally, Tamil people have also taught a lesson to certain forces within the Tamil diaspora who have thrown money to many parties and groups with the aim of controlling Tamil politics here in a manner to their liking."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House on Sunday, ending his bid for reelection following a disastrous debate with Donald Trump that raised doubts about his fitness for office just four months before the election.",
        "The decision comes after escalating pressure from Biden’s Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president’s many falsehoods. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump, and encouraged his party to united behind her.",
        "Biden plans to serve out the remainder of his term in office, which ends at noon ET on Jan. 20, 2025.",
        "“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter posted to his X account.",
        "Nearly 30 minutes later, Biden threw his support behind Harris, the party’s instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago.",
        "“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” he said in another post on X. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.”",
        "Biden’s decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide “detail” about his decision.",
        "The announcement is the latest jolt to a campaign for the White House that both political parties see as the most consequential election in generations, coming just days after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.",
        "A party’s presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. The closest parallel would be President Lyndon Johnson who, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term.",
        "Now, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and persuade voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden.",
        "The decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden’s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years.",
        "Biden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate.",
        "Harris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign’s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.",
        "Biden’s backing helps clear the way for Harris, but a smooth transition is by no means assured.",
        "The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.",
        "It remained to be seen whether other candidates woul challenge Harris for the nomination or how party may need to adjust its rules again to smooth Harris’ nomination on the floor.",
        "Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Biden’s decision to leave the race, but he and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear. Nonetheless, his team has ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified.",
        "Democratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden’s decision.",
        "“His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.”",
        "In 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it.",
        "Biden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump.",
        "“Probably 50 of them,” Biden replied. “No, I’m not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.”",
        "Biden is already the country’s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was “watch me.”",
        "And watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years.",
        "Concerns over Biden’s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump.",
        "Biden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn’t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot.",
        "“I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,” he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. “Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.”",
        "But voters had other problems with him, too — he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he’s handling his job, and he’s faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration.",
        "Biden’s age surfaced as a major factor during an investigation of his handling of classified documents. Special counsel Robert Hur said in February that the president came across in interviews with investigators as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”",
        "The president’s allies seized on the statement as gratuitous and criticized Hur for including it in his report, and Biden himself angrily pushed back on descriptions of how he spoke about his late son.",
        "Biden’s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Barack Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump’s comments following a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials.",
        "Trump said: “You had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides.”",
        "That a sitting president didn’t unequivocally condemn racism and white supremacy deeply offended Biden. Then, Biden won the 2020 election and Trump refused to concede and stood by for hours while his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, beating and bloodying law enforcement in a failed attempt to overturn the certification of Biden’s win.",
        "“If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” Biden once said during at a campaign event.",
        "Biden’s wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president’s announcement by reposting Biden’s letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis.",
        "Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media that “I’m nothing but proud of my Pop.” She said he has served the country “with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction” and that “our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.”"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "By any standard, Sri Lanka is recovering from economic bankruptcy today, though chief economic policymakers seem to be disputing the claim of bankruptcy.i In the case of a private venture, bankruptcy means inability to honour financial obligations to outsiders due to its financial net worth becoming negative. By the same token, the bankruptcy of a country means that it is not able to honour its debt obligations to foreign creditors or a given segment of foreign creditors.",
        "In April 2022, Sri Lanka announced that it will not honour the debt servicing obligations – that is, repayment of the principal and payment of interest on the debt when they become due – in the case of two selected foreign creditors, commercial and bilateral creditors. Since then, several policy measures have been taken by Sri Lankan authorities to get out of the economic crisis and place the country on a sustainable growth path.",
        "Sri Lanka applied for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the external sector stability, on one side, and establish credibility among the foreign donors, on the other. This facility amounting to $ 2.9 billion was granted to the country by IMF in March 2023 subject to an IMF supported reform program concerning the fiscal sector, monetary sector, external sector, and the real sector. Sri Lanka met all the quantitative and structural benchmarks agreed with IMF except the requirement to agree on a viable debt restructuring with commercial and bilateral creditors. The foreign debt restructuring plan is presently being pursued and the governmental authorities have expressed confidence that it could be completed by June 2024.ii This is a postponement of the target date which earlier had been fixed for September 2023.iii",
        "In the meantime, inflation rate has been brought down from about 70% in September 2022 to a single digit number by end 2023. The exchange rate which fell to Rs. 370 per US dollar in mid 2022 has now been stabilised around Rs. 320 a dollar. Economic growth which was in the negative region for six consecutive quarters since January 2022 made a turnaround by the third quarter of 2023 promising that in 2024 and beyond, the country will have a growth albeit at a low rate.",
        "The state of the economy attained by Sri Lanka has been termed a low-level equilibrium in which the output is below the potential by President’s economic advisor, Dr. Sharmini Cooray, who delivered the Central Bank Anniversary Oration in 2023.iv Emphasising that the country’s economic crisis is not yet over, she had noted that the way out has been to “grow at a rate of about 5-6% a year in a sustainable inclusive way”. She further noted that “Without such growth, we cannot escape our high debt burden even after a successful restructuring. And because the debt burden lies with the public sector, the public sector will need to contract not just this year, but also in the decade ahead. So growth will need to come from the private sector and be export-oriented given our foreign exchange needs. There is simply no other option”.",
        "Cooray has presented her critical review of many other structural reforms that have been adopted by Sri Lanka since the agreement with IMF for the ongoing EFF. I will confine my analysis on the above diagnosis of Sri Lanka’s ailments and the prescription recommended for Sri Lanka to get out of the external debt issue looming over the country.",
        "Since my topic is also concerned with the issue of sustainable growth, it is necessary to make the following clarification about two sides of sustainable growth being debated by economists. One is the sustainable development from the quality of life and conservation of resources as presented by The World Commission on Environment and Development, known as the Bruntland Commission. The Commission has defined the sustainable development as ensuring “that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.v This is a medium to long term goal requiring both the domestic and global community to cooperate with each other.",
        "The other is sustaining growth continuously once it has been kicked off by the help of some outside force. In the case of Sri Lanka, this initial support maybe given by a country like India or by multilateral agency like the World Bank, IMF, or ADB. Since it is not proper to give this support continuously due to the apparent moral hazard issue, it should be withdrawn after a given timeframe. If the country is able to stand on its own feet and sustain the growth momentum, it is sustainable development from this point.vi This is a goal which a nation should endeavour to attain continuously. In the case of Sri Lanka today, both these approaches to sustainability are applicable and relevant.",
        "No country can get out of poverty, or indebtedness without having sustained economic expansion. It is the economic surplus that is produced that will be used to reduce poverty through new investments and repay the creditors without being indebted further. However, growth is necessary but not sufficient to sustain the expansion of an economy. Growth will produce a higher volume of goods and services for consumption by people. But unless the people within the country have purchasing power to buy the same, producers will find that they are saddled with unsold stocks. Therefore, in the second year, they will cut back production leading to a reduction in the growth rate. The real purchasing power of a population is determined by the income after taxes, both direct and indirect, and the level of prices in the economy. On both counts, the real purchasing power of people is severely constrained.",
        "The high income and commodity taxes that have been imposed on Sri Lankans to achieve fiscal stability through increased revenue without cutting the Government expenditure has taken about 12% out of the incomes earned by people. However, taxes are only visible payments made by people curtailing the purchase of goods and services produced through economic expansion. The actual burden falling on people, following the burden analysis of the English economist David Ricardo,vii is the total gross expenditure of the Government. In the recent years, this has amounted to about 40% of GDP in Sri Lanka. Of this 40%, the bulk goes out of the country through interest payments and foreign loan repayments made by the Government without creating demand for locally produced goods and services. The other bulk is used for paying salaries, pensions, and subsidies to people.",
        "The real purchasing power of that income too falls due to high level of prices, though the rate of increase in prices is subdued in the recent months through severely restrictive monetary policies. Hence, to sustain economic expansion, the domestic market is not capable of buying the increased flow of goods and services produced through economic growth. This is evident from the drastic decline of micro, medium, and small enterprises in Sri Lanka by May 2023 compared to their best performing year, 2018, as revealed by the survey on the impact of the economic crisis on MSMEs in Sri Lanka conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics in 2023.viii",
        "This problem can be partly resolved if Sri Lanka is able to export a sizeable volume of its products, in the form of goods as well as services, to foreigners. In the recent past, this has amounted to about 15% of GDP. It is necessary to increase the share of the export of goods and services to compensate for the low purchasing power of people due to high taxes and increased high Government expenditure, exacerbated by increased cost of living. This requires Sri Lanka to change the structure of its exports to suit the requirements of foreign buyers. The present visible export structure is heavily skewed toward the apparels and the three tree exports, namely, tea, rubber, and coconuts. Sri Lanka became a beneficiary of the wave of offshoring that took place in 1970s and 1980s seeking after low wages. With rising inflation and the gradual increase in income levels, the low wage advantage is no longer available to Sri Lanka.",
        "Amidst this market distortion, Sri Lanka has been hampered by two other adverse developments as well. One is the transfer of apparel industry to other low-wage countries like Bangladesh, East Africa, and East Asia. The other is the attempt made by major buyers of apparels to locate manufacturing plants close to markets, known as nearshoring, and in the buying countries themselves, known as onshoring, facilitated by automation and advancements in technology.ix Sri Lanka’s main tree export, tea, has been affected by the change in the global tastes, production technologies, and deficiencies in marketing strategies.x",
        "Both apparels and tree exports are based on simple technologies. At present, the world is moving toward high-tech manufacturing and Sri Lanka has no choice but to follow the changing trends in global manufacturing technologies. This cannot be attained in the short to medium term. Hence, a proper action plan should be designed to facilitate the country to make a seamless transmission to high-tech manufacturing over the next decade.",
        "In this context, it is necessary to change the scope of the free trade agreements to be signed by Sri Lanka with some of the fast moving neighbours like India, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines to comprehensive technological and economic partnerships. It is also necessary for Sri Lanka to join the global production sharing networks to harness the best for the country.xi",
        "Sri Lanka cannot promote its export sector while having an unproductive tariff structure and restrictions on imports.xii Since Sri Lanka’s manufacturing exports are highly dependent on imported raw materials and components, without a free flow of imports, it cannot ensure an uninterrupted production of export goods. Import restrictions had a role to play when the country was burdened with a severe foreign exchange problem in 2022 and 2023. At present, the country does not have a severe foreign exchange problem as being revealed by the progressive accumulation foreign reserves by the Central Bank performing better than the quantitative benchmark of $ 1.4 billion agreed with IMF under EFF.",
        "The foreign reserves as at end-2023, except the $ 1.5 billion agreed with people’s Bank of China under a promised SWAP facility which is not counted for reserves, stood at $ 2.9 billion. Hence, with the improved foreign exchange flows, it is now time to remove all the prohibitive restrictions on import of raw materials and other components needed for manufacturing.xiii The motto for Sri Lanka to expand its manufacturing exports should be ‘import freely and develop exports’.",
        "Sri Lanka’s growth facilitation requires careful short to medium term economic policy designing and management. At the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, there is a special course on development policy and management taught at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels emphasising on the management side of economic policies. The management of economic policy at the national level requires goals to be presented in the form of a plan and then, the plan broken into projects, projects to programs, and programs to activities at the planning side. The activities with targets and key performance criteria should be monitored continuously for successful realisation. If there is underperformance, it should be immediately attended to by introducing the necessary corrective measures.",
        "Sri Lanka plans to become a fully developed country by 2048 when it celebrates the centenary of independence from Britain as pronounced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his address to the Parliament in August 2022.xiv He said that to attain the development goal of the country, the economy will be transformed into a competitive export economy, an apparent recognition that the domestic economy is not strong enough to sustain high economic growth.  Addressing the nation in June 2023, Wickremesinghe outlined his policy management strategy to become a developed country by 2048.xv Accordingly, the Government will be using the Growth Lab approach – a technique developed by the Centre for International Development of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government – to design the policy strategy to reach the goal. In this approach, the private sector leaders, bureaucrats and Cabinet ministers will be assembled in a six week long policy retreat. The timeframe given was that the Lab will be convened in July, its report ready by September in the form of a national transformation plan, and it will be signed off by people by end 2023.",
        "Showing that Sri Lanka is weak in policy management, none of the milestones in the timeline announced has been met. But addressing Parliament in February 2024, Wickremesinghe announced that his Government will introduce an economic transformation act to Parliament soon which is a narrowing of focus from national to economic matters.xvi The objective of the new legislation, as was announced by Wickremesinghe, is to transform Sri Lanka’s backward economy to a modern, robust economy. The details of this act have not been revealed but it is presumed that it is the same national transformation plan, in a narrowed focus, which the Government was hoping to design under the Lab approach announced in June 2023.",
        "It seems that the plan has been prepared without the participation of the private sector leaders or the people of the country thereby ignoring the essential requirements of the democratic economic policy governance to which Wickremesinghe has subscribed to under his social market economy ideology. It is a serious weakness in the development policy management and, therefore, is inclined to meet with public protests.",
        "The Central Bank, following the IMF’s EFF, has stabilised to a reasonable degree the prices, and the exchange rate. Since the foreign debt restructuring is still not completed, even that stability appears to be a temporary solation. The Government’s plan to address the fiscal sector issues through revenue based consolidation, as recommended by IMF, is defective. By continuously increasing taxes and adding new taxes to the book, the Government seems to be going after a moving target without a corresponding reduction in the gross expenditure of the Government.",
        "Hence, it should be a hybrid of both revenue increasing and expenditure cutting fiscal consolidation. This requires the shrinkage of the public sector as recommended by Cooray in her Central Bank Anniversary Oration referred to above.",
        "But as the data reveal, the shrinkage has come not by economising on consumption expenditure but through a drastic cut in capital expenditure. For instance, the much praised surplus in the primary balance of the Budget in 2023 has come from a cut in the planned capital expenditure of Rs. 1,000 billion to about Rs. 500 billion. With weakened private investments, the decline in public investments will hamper the country’s growth prospects substantially. What this means is that economic reawakening is still not fully established as a goal in the country’s development policy and management strategies.",

      "original_title": "Medical Humanities:an interdisciplinary approach to holistic health",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The Department of Medical Humanities at the University of Colombo’s Medical Faculty is another groundbreaking initiative by the institution as the pioneer of the discipline here at home and in South Asia. In an interview with the Sunday Island, Clinical Psychologist and Head of the Department of Medical Humanities, Dr. Santushi Amarasuriya elucidates on how this discipline, which is gaining momentum the world over, explores human experiences of health and illness drawing from a spectrum of other social and aesthetic branches.",
        "Q: Could you please share the ‘story’ behind the establishment of the Department of Medical Humanities at the Colombo Medical Faculty?",
        "A:The Department of Medical Humanities was established in 2016 in response to global trends which recognize the role of medical humanities in medical education. It helps medical practitioners to reorient themselves into a holistic and person-centered approach to health care. There was also a general recognition of the impact of burnout and resultant empathy-deficits among medical practitioners, with medical humanities seen as a mechanism through which doctors can understand, reflect upon and deal with such issues. It is in recognition of all this that our Department was established.",
        "Medical humanities lies at the intersection of medicine and humanities. It draws from various disciplines; from literature and philosophy to ethics and arts. The scope of medical humanities is very broad and therefore we find varying definitions of it. How we define it here at the Colombo Medical Faculty, is as ‘humanities in the pursuit of improving the well being and achieving goals in medical education.’ Our goal is to use medical humanities to foster compassionate care, professionalism and ethical practice among medical and other health care professionals, whilst also being sensitive to the socio-cultural context in Sri Lanka.",
        "If we look at the specific history of how the department came into being, one of the highlights was when a brand-new stream called the Behavioural Sciences Stream, first conceptualized by Prof. Nalaka Mendis, was established within the curriculum of our Faculty in 1995. This was a pioneering effort that recognized the transition of the medical model of illness, which focused primarily on biological factors, into what is known as the bio-psychosocial model of health and illness in the late 70s. This latter model takes a more holistic approach and recognizes that there are psychological and social elements that also determine the outcomes of an illness.",
        "Then, during a revision of the Behavioural Sciences Stream curriculum in 2013, Prof. Panduka Karunanayake proposed the establishment of a Medical Humanities Unit. The ensuing discussions led to Prof. Godwin Constantine proposing the establishment of a department. Subsequently, Prof. Saroj Jayasinghe, who was the Chairperson of the Behavioural Sciences Stream at the time became the driving force in establishing the Department in 2016, becoming its founder Head.",
        "I was the first permanent academic staff member to have been recruited to the Behavioural Sciences Stream in 2006 and after the establishment of the Department of Medical Humanities in 2016, I came on board as its first Senior Lecturer.",
        "Q: Could you elaborate on the nature of the learning enabled for the medical student by the Department and how medical humanities help students to brave a demanding curriculum with empathy and kindness?",
        "A: Our main teaching input is through the Humanities, Society and Professional Stream, previously known as the Behavioural Sciences Stream. We provide input into areas of personality development and psychology, communication skills, ethical practice, professionalism, and humaneness, utilizing different teaching methodologies.",
        "If I were to address the topic of empathy that you highlighted, many of our activities try to cultivate this skill in students. However, I would say it is not easy to develop. Many studies have shown that when medical students reach the third year, which is when they start their clinical rotations and need empathy the most, there is actually a decline of it. This is referred to as the ‘devil in the third year’. Many reasons are attributed to this. For example, what was hypothetical is now actually real and students are suddenly overwhelmed with a higher level of responsibility because now they are taking care of real people. There is also a marked increase in workload and it could also be the lack of role models. All this might lead to a decline in empathy. But we must remember that empathy is a hard job, stepping into another person’s shoes and understanding their problems, such as what is making them distressed. To make it even more challenging, it would be multiple patients whose shoes they have to step into and that can be really exhausting.",
        "As a human being, your natural defense mechanism would be to detach yourself and not be empathetic. Therefore, what we try to do is to recalibrate, talk about and reinforce the importance of it.",
        "Q: Could you please explain how the wide range of disciplines coming under medical humanities is translated into actual practice by physicians?",
        "A: One of the methodologies that we have adopted is to use narratives in medicine. Very early in the students’ career, we ask them to go and draw from patients their personal story, and NOT their clinical history. This helps to cultivate a holistic approach to medicine. As a clinician, when you take a clinical history, you are very cognizant that there is a lot more going on for the patient than merely their disease.",
        "A simple exercise that some international institutions utilize is to take students on a gallery visit where they are asked to study portraits to sharpen their finer observational skills; they start learning to notice certain physical signs or certain subtle cues that may have escaped attention. Therefore, at the point of their interaction with patients, they become more attuned to reading many nonverbal cues. For example, take a well-known painting like the Mona Lisa. Closer observation reveals her pale complexion, swollen hands and puffiness around her eyes, which can be used to hypothesize possible ailments she may have suffered from.",
        "Similarly, certain films can be used to create a stimulating dialogue about patient-experiences. They are able to trigger strong emotional reactions and then also provide a safe space to discuss difficult topics which may be inaccessible if only relying on personal experiences. Another tool that I personally find fascinating, that is adopted by some of our colleagues in the region, is the use of the ‘spectator’ concept within forum theatre, where the spectators have the opportunity to intervene and become the actors to change the outcomes of stories depicting difficult situations.",
        "This highlights and empowers the students in their future roles as reflective change agents. Medical students can also be helped to actually step into the patient’s shoes and share the experience of the patient. For example, what is it like to be wheelchair-bound or lack the use of a limb so that they could relate to a patient’s situation better. There is a wide array of methodologies, and this is important given the diversity of student preferences.",
        "Q Is it justifiable to say that this interdisciplinary approach has gained momentum today as the innate ‘humane humaneness’ coupled with professionalism which was found in the good old doctor of yesteryear is largely eroding today, replaced by a stereotypical fact-finder?",
        "A: The importance of humaneness in medical care is well recognized now. The concept of person-centred or patient-centered care is known to a medical student and medical curricula all over the world are adopting these concepts now. If you ask a medical student what empathy is, they will regurgitate the definition and they also know it is important. I would argue that maybe in the good old days these definitions might have been rather alien, but the values these definitions entail may have been innate in most physicians.",
        "That is not to say that there aren’t many students with such skills today. But previously, medical professionals might have had time to actually cultivate these abilities and skills; they might have been able to immerse themselves in the arts. Whereas now, the landscape is very different due to the sheer volume of information to digest, too many competing demands and so forth. Therefore, it becomes a matter of prioritization and many are driven to only focus on the more tangible and measurable elements.",
        "A second reason is the structure of our education. If you take the A-Levels, it’s a rat race to get into the medical faculty and how you get there is by knowing all the information to answer the questions. Along the way you may not have had time for extensive reflection or contemplation. The student who comes to us is trained in that way. So, when they take a clinical history, they may be more driven to simply gather data and make a diagnosis. They forget the holistic nature of the interaction along the way.",
        "Q: Do you think the relevance of medical humanities is unprecedented today given the shift in socio-economic dynamics in society?",
        "A: As a country we have faced several calamities and the most recent one is the economic crisis. Along with it there are several other problems that our people have to face: a significant number is impoverished and there has been a lack of medical supplies and an exodus in the medical profession itself. So, if you think about the professionals working today, they are overloaded with work, and this can lead to a sense of helplessness and frustration.",
        "If you place it within Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, they may be struggling to meet basic needs. So higher-level needs like compassion and empathy start to look more like “nice-to-haves” than necessities, given that they are trying to deliver in a context that is resource-poor. It really is a balancing act. Therefore, it is often all too easy to satisfy ourselves with aggregate numbers. For instance, we say there are low rates of infant mortality and few maternal deaths. But what we might overlook in those aggregates is the experience that the patient has had in this whole process. What we do in our curriculum is re calibrate and remind them of what is finally needed.",
        "Q: Today many patients lament that doctors are ‘poor communicators’, that their body language often doesn’t foster a sense of comfort and security in a patient. How does medical humanities envisage to address this so that doctors can be better communicators?",
        "A: As a Faculty, we all endorse the importance of communication skills, and the input is given at different stages not only through our Humanities, Society and Professionalism Stream (HSPS) but through the other teaching arms as well. Interestingly, many students know the science behind communication practices, such as starting with an open-ended question, but they may not know HOW to do it. There’s a lot of art in asking a question. Although they may not have the innate gift of being effective communicators, with the right training, they can be developed into very successful ones.",
        "In some of our activities we use different works of art, such as movies, paintings, poems, stories and so forth. In the recent past, we have used the painting titled ‘The Doctor’ by Luke Fildes. In the painting, a doctor is hovering over an ill child and we ask the students to interpret what’s going on. A lot is being communicated in this visual such as the stance of the doctor, the nonverbal behaviour, and in the background are the child’s parents who have entrusted the child to the doctor’s care. So just asking the students to analyze it and talk about it helps them to reflect. We use many other such methodologies to foster good communication in future doctors.",
        "Another tool we often use is role-play. We recently launched a Communication Skills Master Class under the guidance of Prof. Dinithi Fernando, the current Chairperson of the HSPS, to give more muscle to the enhancement of communication skills.",
        "Q: What are Sri Lanka’s strengths as a multi-cultural and a hospitable nation that medical humanities could draw from?",
        "A: We are a collective community and helping another human being in distress, is very much a part of our culture. It comes very naturally and that translates into the process of healing a patient in distress. Kindness and compassion are key messages that are collectively shared by all our religions practiced here at home. If you consider kindness, I think of it at two levels: people whose core is kind and those who superficially reflect kind behaviour such as talking in a nice way and similar social graces. But this second category may not be kind deep down. Now if you think about our cultural orientation, it is that first one which is emphasized- kindness at the core. What we are trying to harness is a natural or deeply culturally-endorsed tendency.",
        "Another example is the cultural sensitivity that we may already possess. We have students coming from different contexts and different experiences. They already recognize the existence of ‘health pluralism’ and that the patient’s conceptualizations of illness and treatment encompass a wide range of practices and beliefs that are not directly relevant to western medical practice. Therefore, it is just a matter of reminding them of these to help them to be more empathetic about patient experiences.",
        "Q: What are the collaborations the Department has forged with professionals outside the medical stream to cultivate a sense of appreciation in aesthetics in future doctors?",
        "A: One good example is our Humanitas programme. This is the brainchild of Prof. Panduka Karunanayake. The Latin term humanitas translates into human nature, civilization and kindness and relates to what it is that makes us human. In this programme we address various human issues – be it a current crisis or a problem like a heart break.",
        "Prof. Karunanayake’s objective in launching this programme was to trigger an emotional reaction and let the other cognitive processes occur on their own. The Humanitas programme is solely directed by Dr. Santhushya Fernando who is a Senior Lecturer in our Department, where she gets in different artists from musicians to poets to talk about such issues and reflect and share their vulnerabilities, giving flavour to the programme. The programme has received very good reviews and all credit for this must go to Dr. Fernando who has spearheaded this programme with passion and enthusiasm.",
        "Similarly, we have been fortunate to receive generous support from the academics of the University of Visual and Performing Arts who have not only made wonderful contributions to the Humanitas programme but to many other activities of the Department.",
        "Q: What inspiration does the Colombo Faculty offer other medical faculties in the country in terms of recognizing medical humanities and what are the future plans of your Department to give a further thrust to medical humanities?",
        "A: Even in terms of the Behavioural Sciences Stream, we were pioneers and all other faculties have now adopted it under different names. It is heartening to note that many of the medical faculties here have taken a cue from our experience. Although they may not have a dedicated department to the discipline, many have incorporated these ideas into their curriculum.",
        "In terms of expansion, we have many plans which are aligned with the goals of our Department such as using the humanities to facilitate health education and training, initiating research by drawing from best practices which could be replicated here at home and also to enrich our curriculum. We plan to explore on how to enable more patient-friendly environments so that our future doctors can actually translate the concepts espoused by the humanities, into actual practice and also explore the role of the discipline in developing therapies or interventions to promote health.",
        "The department has now been allocated a larger space within the Faculty to grow and expand but lacks facilities to make it an occupiable space. We are seeking donations from philanthropists and wellwishers to make this project a reality.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The  Ilankai  Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) known in English as the Federal Party will celebrate its 75th Birthday in December this year. The premier political party of the Sri Lankan Tamil people known as “Ilankai Thamizhar”in  their mother tongue was born on 18 December 1949. On that day, a group of sixty Tamils including two parliamentarians and two senators  convened at the Government Clerical Service Union (GCSU) hall in Colombo.",
        "That historic conclave resulted in the launching  of  a new political party with the avowed goal of establishing an autonomous State for  the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) within a united island. The new party was named in Tamil as “Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi” meaning Ceylon  Tamil State or Tamil Government Party.",
        "However, the party’s founders described it as Federal Party in English. According to renowned political scientist Prof. A.J. Wilson, the new party’s name was not Federal Party but merely an explanation of what the party stood for. “Its leaders insisted that the word ‘State’ denoted a unit within a federal set-up and not a sovereign State as some of its detractors alleged,” wrote Wilson in his book titled ‘Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism.’.",
        "Officially, the new party was named in English as “Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi” and became known by the acronym ITAK. In popular parlance, it was called the Federal Party or FP. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam was elected as the first president of the fledgling party while Dr. E.M.V. Naganathan and V. Navaratnam were the joint general secretaries. It was the ITAK which introduced the demand for federalism into Sri  Lanka’s post-independence political discourse. Although 74 years has passed since the party was born, ITAK continues to remain wedded to the federal idea.",
        "A Tamil political party completing 75 years of existence in the Sri Lankan political landscape is indeed a milepost achievement. As such the  75th birthday party would indeed be a joyful event for the ITAK/FP. Unfortunately there is an atmosphere of doubt as to who would cut the  cake or light up the candles for the festive occasion because the party is currently in the grip of a crisis of its own making. It is uncertain whether the situation would change for the better or worse by the end of the year.",
        "The ITAK’s  current internal  crisis began with its long -delayed party convention and election of new office-bearers early this year. For the first time in the ITAK’s history, intra-party elections took place for the key post of President. Three contenders were in the fray.",
        "An inner party election to elect a new leader is by itself a welcome feature. However, the ITAK has from its inception never experienced an inner party poll to elect its President. The party adopted the practice of avoiding a direct contest and instead opted to elect the leader unanimously. From the time it was founded in 1949, the ITAK/FP has followed this consensual method of electing the leader.",
        "Samuel  James  Veluppillai Chelvanayakam was the respected  co-founder and first president of the ITAK/FP.  SJV could have remained President of the party during his lifetime if he had wanted to. Chelva however stepped down as President after his first two  terms and let others succeed him.",
        "Nevertheless Chelva remained the supreme leader while his deputies like Vanniasingham, Naganathan, Rajavarothayam, Rasamanickam and Amirthalingam served as party Presidents in rotation.",
        "There was no election as an arrangement by consensus with Chelva’s blessings would be worked out early. In 1973 there was a possibility of an election with the then Vaddukkoddai ex-MP Appapillai Amirthalingam and the then Batticaloa MP Chelliah Rajadurai vying with each other for the party Presidency. It was feared that the tussle could rupture the party. Chelva intervened and persuaded Rajadurai to withdraw from the contest.",
        "Many persons concerned about the future of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka including this writer were worried about the impact an intra-party election would have on the premier Tamil party and urged that a polarising poll be avoided. Such entreaties fell on deaf ears.  It was stated on behalf of the contenders that an inner party election was “Uchapatcha Jananayagam” (highest form of democracy). It was boastfully said that the ITAK was the only Sri Lankan party that had inner party elections to elect the leader.",
        "Little did these “know-alls”realise that they were indirectly insulting Chelvanayakam as being “undemocratic” by saying this. They also failed to comprehend that avoiding a divisive election and arriving at a consensual agreement was also a democratic virtue.",
        "The election brought the  prevalent fault -lines within the party to the fore. Divisive tendencies  were exacerbated and ego-clashes proliferated. Emmanuel Kant’s profound observation  “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.” came true again.",
        "As a result the  ITAK election matter went to court. An enjoining order issued by courts  has debarred the newly elected party president and other key office-bearers from functioning.  Sadly the ITAK seems incapable of even presenting a united legal defence.",
        "Since the matter is pending before court, I shall refrain from commenting further on this issue. One thing however seems obvious. The ITAK’s troubles are far from over.. The party is on the decline with the distinct possibility of future  fragmentation. Furthermore infiltration by extraneous elements is seemingly underway.",
        "There is belated enlightenment now that the veteran political leader Chelvanayakam knew what he was doing when he strove to avoid divisive inner -party elections and instead adopted selection by consensus. It is against this backdrop therefore that this column focuses this week on the founder -leader of the ITAK. SJV Chelvanayakam passed away  at the age of 79  on 26  April 1977.  His 47th death anniversary will be commemorated next week.",
        "Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayakam was born in Ipoh ,Malaysia on 31st March 1898.  He was from Thellippalai in Jaffna. His father Visvanathan Veluppillai was a businessman in Malaysia. SJV’s mother Harriet Annamma’s maiden name was Kanapathippillai.When Chelvanayakam was four years of age the family with the exception of his father moved back to Thellippalai so that the children could obtain a good education.",
        "SJV a protestant christian attended Union College Thellippalai, St. John’s College Jaffna and finally St. Thomas’ College Mt. Lavinia (located at Mutwal then Chelva first graduated as an external student of the London University. He got a B Sc. He then began teaching at ST. Thomas’s College Mt. Lavinia. Later he moved to Wesley College as a teacher.",
        "While teaching he pursued studies in law and soon enrolled himself as an Advocate of the Supreme Court. He confined himself to Civil matters mainly and built up a lucrative practice. He became a respected civil lawyer and took silk in due course.In 1927 he married Emily Grace Barr Kumarakulasinghe the daughter of RR Barr Kumarakulasinghe the “Maniaghar” (Administrative Chief) of Thellippalai.",
        "The man who advocated Tamil rights with a missionary zeal was not one who engaged himself in politics willingly.During the tumultuous Donoughmore era Chelva  while observing political developments keenly kept aloof of Tamil politics. He first showed an open interest in politics in the forties when he accosted GG Ponnambalam at the Colombo Law Library and voluntarily affixed his signature to a memorandum being sent to Whitehall on the Tamil question.",
        "Thereafter Chelvanayakam began involving himself more closely with Tamil Political affairs and became active in the Tamil Congress. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation led by GG Ponnambalam that made representations to the Soulbury Commission. Soon Chelvanayakam began immersing himself in Tamil Congress activities and by 1946 was considered the “vice-captain” of Ponnambalam.",
        "Jane Russell describes this development in her book “Communal politics under the DonoughmoreConstitution” in the following manner-",
        "“The emergence of SJV Chelvanayakam, a christian and a Colombo Lawyer as Ponnambalam’s second-in-command was significant. Unlike Ponnambalam who was concerned largely in satisfying his personal ambitions for power, Chelvanayakam was seriously concerned with the political effect of the Sinhala Buddhist cultural resurgence on the future of the Ceylon Tamils.”",
        "“ Chelvanayakam was a thoughtful man; as a politician he displayed the integrity which Ponnambalam lacked. His Tamil communalism was not the froth of an opportunist but a deeply-felt and considered judgement backed by an appreciation of Tamil culture which amounted to blind loyalty. Chelvanayakam’s attachment to the Ceylon Tamil culture came much closer to a true Tamil nationalism and his gloomy views and oracular attitude proclaimed him the heir to the aged Ponnambalam Arunachalam who had turned in his bitterness from the ideal of a united Lanka to the concept of a Tamilnad or Pan-Tamilian state in his solstitial years.”",
        "“ Although SJV.Chelvanayakam did not present a differentiated policy to that of GG.Ponnambalam in 1947, his political approach augered a radical change in the tone and demeanour of Ceylon Tamil politics in the post-Independence period”",
        "In 1947 the Tamil Congress contested elections to Parliament and won seven sea seats, Chelvanayakam himself contested and won Kankesanthurai polling 12,126. Soon political differences began erupting between Ponnambalam and Chelvanayakam over the future course of the Tamil Congress.",
        "Prof. A.J. Wilson, son-in-law of Chelvanayakam in his book “SJV Chelvanayakam and the crisis of Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism, 1947-1977” describes the situation thus",
        "“Ponnambalam interpreted the mandate of responsive cooperation” with progressive-minded Sinhalese parties, received at the general election of 1947 as an authorisation to the ACTC by the Tamil electorate to secure portfolios in the cabinet, where a Tamil presence would enable Tamil problems to be aired and benefits obtained for the Tamil areas.”",
        "“ Chelvanayakam for his part preferred to use Tamil cooperation as a lever to obtain an acceptable resolution of Tamil concerns relating to citizenship rights for the Indian Tamil plantation workers, parity of status for the Sinhala and Tamil languages, an acceptable national flag for the new State and the cessation of state-aided colonisation of the Tamil speaking areas with Sinhala colonists. He wanted these pre-conditions satisfied. Most important he wanted a constitutional assembly convened to determine the Island’s future constitutional structure. Ponnambalam did not obtain these guarantees”",
        "Even after Ponnambalam became a minister and voted with the government on Citizenship issues . Chelvanayakam did not break away immediately. Instead he dilly-dallied as to whether he should remain within Tamil Congress ranks and fight it out with Ponnambalam or whether he should form a new political party. Finally he broke away with Kopay MP Vanniyasingham and Senator EMV Naganathan. The Federal Party or Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi in Tamil was inaugurated  in 1949 December.",
        "Chelvanayakam and his party ushered in an Ideological shift in Tamil politics. He formulated Tamil nationalism on linguistic lines and channelled that into a clearly demarcated territory thereby providing a territorial dimension. The Northern and Eastern Provinces were the traditional homelands of the Tamil speaking people. These provinces would form an autonomous Tamil State (Thamil Arasu). This state would come into a federal arrangement with the residual Sinhala state and remain within a Ceylonese union.",
        "The party sought equality of status for both the Sinhala and Tamil languages. This demand was not for the Ceylon Tamils alone but for all Tamil speaking people such as the Muslims and The UP-Country Tamils. The party was also against the demographic structure of the Tamil Traditional homeland being altered through Sinhala colonisation.",
        "The political advent of  the ITAK/FP  under Chelva  was resented by Sinhala political leaders  who  made uncharitable,unkind  remarks about him then.“He is a lean and hungry looking man whom I cannot trust” said DS Senanayake of Chelvanayakam.",
        "SWRD Bandaranaike’s comment on Chelvanayakam was “He is surely one of the most dangerous types of human beings in the world, quite in his own way an idealist sincere, in his own way an idealist, but having no idea whatsoever of reality and the practical side of things. Very dangerous people, such people”.",
        "This then was the sad state of affairs that prevailed then. The man who espoused non-violence and displayed the positive attribute of willingness to settle for something far short of his original demands was portrayed as untrustworthy and dangerous. No meaningful attempt was made to settle the problem peacefully with Chelvanayakam then.",
        "The ITAK under Chelvanayakam began a new culture of political protest. This was “Non-violent agitation” modelled on Gandhian Philosophy. The first major demonstration was the Satyagraha launched on Galle Face Green when Parliament was debating the Official Language Act. Thugs and hoodlums backed by politicians in power set upon the Satyagrahis and mercilessly assaulted them while the police watched with their “hands Tied”.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s son himself was assaulted in front of the Father while SJV sat unflinching. The Tamil poet Kasi Anandan immortalised that episode through a poignant poem.",
        "Other non-violent activities such as protest marches, black flag demonstrations, hartals, boycotts.letter writing campaigns, non compliance of administrative regulations.tar brush campaigns, fasts  and Satyagrahas were continuously undertaken  along with political mass meetings, processions, rallies and Conventions.All these activities made the Tamil People a highly politicised community.",
        "Chelvanayakam was now described as “Thanthai Chelva” and “Eelathu Gandhi” by his followers. “Thanthai” came from the Dravidian movement where the father of the Dravidian movement EV Ramaswamy Naicker was called “Thanthai” Periyar. “Eelathu Gandhi or the Gandhi of Eelam was from the Indian Congress culture. Most Party followers referred to him as “Periyavar”. Chelvanayakam had now acquired cult status and was almost a Venerated figure.",
        "Among the agitations conducted by the ITAK  the most notable ones were the anti-Sri tar brush campaign and the mass Satyagraha of 1961. Chelvanayakam himself was jailed in Batticaloa in 1958 over the tar brush campaign .",
        "In 1961 the Northern and Eastern Provinces were administratively paralysed when Tamil Satyagrahis campaigned opposite Govt Secretariats. The Campaign reached its climax when a separate postal service was set up and   Stamps,stamped envelopes and postcards  issued. Finally the Army was called in, Curfew imposed and Tamil leaders including Chelvanayakam detained and placed under house arrest. Chelvanayakam along with ITAK leaders had been detained in 1958 too.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s strategy when dealing with the Governments in power had been that of agitation cum negotiation. In fairness to the ITAK  it had despite it’s rhetoric and non-violent campaigns been more than willing to talk to the governments in power and arrive at a political settlement.",
        "In order to achieve political accommodation Chelvanayakam and the ITAK/FP compromised to a great extent on their original positions. For instance they were amenable to regional councils and district councils instead of a formal federal set-up. They were ready to settle for special provisions regarding the use of the Tamil Language instead of rigid Official Language Status.",
        "Yet, sadly agreements entered into with two Prime Ministers were honoured in the breach in the face of mounting Sinhala extremist pressure. The Bandaranaike- Chelvanayakam pact of 1957 as well as the Senanayake-Chelvanayakam pact of 1965 if implemented may have resolved the Tamil problem long before it assumed such violent proportions. Likewise if Tamil grievances had been redressed when articulated in non-violent form through leaders such as Chelvanayakam armed violence need not have risen among Tamil Youths.",
        "In spite of Chelvanayakam’s apparent failure to resolve the Tamil problem through negotiations the Tamil People did not consider it his fault. The Tamil People perceived it as the fault of Sinhala leaders who had betrayed Chelvanayakam and by extension therefore the Tamils. Thus Chelvanayakam and the ITAK  could continue to win the bulk of Tamil Parliamentary seats. 10 in 1956,15 in 1960 Mar, 16 in 1960 July, 14 in 1965,13 in 1970.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s greatest electoral achievement occurred in the twilight of his life. He resigned his KKS constituency in 1972 Oct and challenged the Govt to an election on the question of the Tamil People accepting or rejecting the new  Republican constitution of May 1972. After considerable delay the by-election was finally held on 3rd Feb 1975. Chelvanayakam obtained an unprecedented 25,927 defeating V Ponnambalam of the Communist party by a majority of 16,470.",
        "SJV Chelvanayakam died  in Jaffna on April 26th 1977. He had a bad fall some weeks before his death and remained in a coma until his demise. His funeral was an exhibition of a genuine outpouring of collective grief never before seen in Jaffna. All shades of political opinion mourned his loss and leaders of different political parties paid their respects by journeying from the South  to Jaffna.",
        "A vote of condolence was passed by Parliament on September 6th 1977. Lalith Athulathmudali, then Minister of Trade said “Samuel James Velupillai Chelvanayakam was born in Ipoh…. ..Ipoh is known as the cleanest City in Malaysia. Perhaps it was in the fitness of things that Mr. Chelvanayakam’s life was marked by a cleanliness unknown in contemporary politics.”",
        "JR Jayewardene then Prime Minister also spoke on the vote of condolence for Chelva. He said “I have not met anyone in my community or any other community who said that Mr. Chelvanayakam would let you down”",
        "These sentiments were merely endorsing what veteran journalist Mervyn de Silva had written in 1963 “For all his physical frailties he is known as the uncrowned King of the North. Chelvanayakam’s antagonists will willingly testify to his integrity”.",
        "Although  Chelvanayakam’s  Christian names were Samuel and James the Biblical figure that had great impact on him was Moses. Chelva saw himself as some kind of latter-day Moses whose mission was to deliver his persecuted people from political slavery into the promised land of milk and honey.",
        "In fact at Chelvanayakam’s memorial service at the CSI Church in Wellawatte Bishop DJ Ambalavanar delivered a moving Eulogical sermon under the text”Let my People Go”. The Biblical verses invoked were from the Old Testament pertaining to Moses, Pharaoh and the Israelites in Egypt",
        "Today the memory of Chelvanayakam has practically faded. The Younger generation thinks that the struggle began with Prabhakaran and does not even know that this man Chelvanayakam led a non-violent struggle for Tamil rights for nearly three decades.",
        "They do not know that this was a leader who was revered as an incorruptible, sincere man who would not let the Tamils down.",
        "They do not realise that if Chelvanayakam had not led the struggle in his own manner there would not have been a Tamil nationalist base for a future armed struggle",
        "The days of Veluppillai Chelvanayakam and his weapons of non-violence are gone and all that remains are memories of the days of Veluppillai Prabakaran and his arsenal of deadly weapons.",
        "The Unkindest cut of all perhaps was delivered by Sivagnanam Shritharan who was elected as the new  President of the  ITAK/FP in Trincomalee  on 21 January 2024.  Instead of paying homage to the party founder, Shritharan made it a point to go to the LTTE great heroes cemetery first. Though there was a Chelvanayakam statue in Trincomalee and the Chelvanayakam Memorial is in Jaffna town, the ITAK president elect chose to visit the “Maaveerar Thuyilum Illam”( resting abode of  great heroes ) at Kanakapuram in Kilinochchi, light camphor and candles.",
        "Shritharan paid his respects to the fallen Tigers and laid “Karthigaipoo” flowers known as flame lily flowers. The botanical names are Liliaceae Glory lily or Gloriosa superba. The LTTE declared this flower as the national flower of Tamil Eelam during its heyday. The red and yellow colours of the flower are the same as LTTE colours too. Shritharan took an oath to the memory of the fallen Tigers and pledged that he would strive to achieve their dreams.",
        "Adding insult to injury was  the ITAK president elect’sinterview to the  London based “Tamil Guardian”.  There was no reference to Chelvanayakam and his role in keeping alive Tamil resistance to Sinhala hegemonism There was no mention of the role played by the ITAK/FP in esposing Tamil nationalism  in the decades before the advent of armed Tamil militancy. Instead Shritharan seemed to suggest that Tamil nationalism commenced from Tamil militancy only (LTTE Martyr graves). I conclude with relevant excerpts –",
        "Shritharan: “As a Member of Parliament serving for the past 14 years; it has been my policy both inside and outside of Parliament that the people should be awakened together with the other activists to garner support for our cause. I have a clear view that it must start from the tombs of the heroes who were martyred. The blueprint for Eelam national liberation has been drawn up accordingly. There may be some of us who have views or misunderstandings against the LTTE.”",
        "“However, most of our General Assembly members, more or less 184 people have voted for me. This means they support my ideology. In other words, the major strength of the party is Tamil nationalism. They have clearly stated that it must begin from the graves of the late Eelam national liberation fighters.”",
        "“So my first salutation is remembering those departed souls. Let us embark on our journey by reflecting on our thoughts about them in our subconscious mind. I don’t mean this will be an armed struggle. We will take full form to achieve a permanent political solution based on the concepts of the national liberation struggle by giving due respect and recognition to the way our fighters and our people sacrificed their lives during the armed struggle. “ .",
        "If the newly elected ITAK/FP president ignores Chelvanayakam’s  historical contribution towards Tamil nationalism and engage in historical revisionism, then what can one expect from the  younger generation of Tamils?",

      "original_title": "Kaithady’s Nuffield School For The Deaf & Blind : Will The New President Save Its Children From The Church?",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The Anglican Church’s Colombo Diocese has three schools for the visually handicapped and hearing impaired: 1) The Nuffield School in Kaithady (or The Deaf and Blind School, as we used to call it), 2) The School for the Blind in Ratmalana and 3) The School for the Deaf, also in Ratmalana. The Kaithady school  was part of my life as a boy. We always attended their Christmas service and were amazed by how well the handicapped children could sing. They would occasionally come to our services at St. James’ Nallur.",
        "The Nuffield School was established in 1956 with 18 students and 4 staff members. By 1961 there were 60 students, with many students residing within.",
        "Taking from one of the schools’ websites, “traditional Hindu Society saw in the deaf or the blind an act of God, which had to be accepted by the individual and the family. Charity and sympathy were given to them in large measures. Education which was sought by all, mainly for white collar jobs, was not thought of for the handicapped children. But an observation of the growth of the school, its popularity, the response of the parents and the public within a short time of its founding, reveals the fact that Nuffield School has developed into an accepted institution in Sri Lanka. […] Classes are conducted from the nursery up to GCE Ordinary Level in the Tamil medium, in addition to vocational training such as typing, carpentry, metal work and welding, beauty-culture and hair-dressing, tailoring etc are offered to the students. Agriculture and rearing of poultry and cattle are also done at Nuffield School. The war destroyed much of that..",
        "The war took its toll on the school in many ways including on qualified and committed staff. The good have largely abandoned Jaffna. Jaffna is now full of stories on how orphanages make hunting grounds for sexual predators.  There were no community networks assuring students  that the Nuffield School for the Deaf and Blind would be the best choice for their children. About 7 years ago (Vasuki Rajasingham’s time as Principal) Nuffield School for the Deaf and Blind  insisted that the  blind students be removed. Trust was broken. Former principal Mr. Samson’s case is ongoing regarding why Principal Samson’s government pension is being refused. Mr Samson was a government teacher and was dismissed by Fr. Philip Nesakumar without following government cadre procedures. Principal Sampson was being paid by the government and not the Board and therefore Fr Nesakumar had no authority to dismiss him without the input of the government. Samson was accused of an affair with a teacher. Mahendran came in as Principal in 2015. He is a Hindu who was baptised and brought in by Fr. Nesakumar. But for reasons I will not get into, Mahendran ended up in prison.",
        "Vasuhi Rajsingham then came as Principal.  She was accused of humiliating senior staff and of hitting a child. She was removed but there are those who want her back.’",
        "Amara is my first cousin. Teaching in Australia, she was persuaded to sell her house, resign her post and join as Principal. When she was simply told that she has the job, she trusted the church and came. That was a big mistake.",
        "When I studied in London my first job was washing plates. My Cypriot boss would not tell me my salary. He simply said let’s see how good you are. My brother advised me to take the job saying he would not go below the minimum hourly wage of 70 p. So I worked hard and at the end of the first day he said he would pay me 25 p. He explained that he is taking a risk because I am an illegal (which I was not). I quit.",
        "It was after starting  work trustingly that Amara was given her appointment letter. It had a clause that she must not talk to any Board Member – a clause that was not part of any previous principal’s letter. Amara refused to sign that letter and was ultimately given a letter without that clause.",
        "It was a clause from a prehistoric labour contract where you can only negotiate with your immediate supervisor, worse than in our tea estates. I wonder whether Board Chairman Bishop Dushantha Rodrigo thinks he is a Cangani supervising a betel chewing tea-plucker.",
        "Nonetheless, Amara has worked miracles at Nuffield. Student numbers are up –  from 124 when she comes to 143 now. A Speech Therapy Center is on.",
        "There has been no complaint of sexual harassment or corporal punishment of students by the principal as before. O. Level results are up. The children are taken to church. She has brought in millions in donor funds – over Rs. 10 million from Canada and almost a million from New Zealand. A function to show case the school is to be held soon with the presence of the diplomatic community.",
        "However, she is harassed by the Board that rarely comes to Kaithady and consists of people on the Board for years knowing little of training the handicapped. This Board sits in Colombo and demands that funds she brought in be given to the two schools at Ratmalana. It is almost 3 years since she came but her quarters are not fully ready. She lived in her office going to a rented room outside for the night.  She has no phone nor computer and uses her personal items.",
        "She complained to the Board of poor wiring and asked many including me for funds. Two weeks ago the electric system overloaded and set off a big fire putting the children in great danger. There have been 2 other fires since then. The Bishop had been warned but took no action on rewiring, his focus being, it seems, on paying several lakhs of supplementary salaries above what the government pays the southern Principals and his office staff, well above what Jaffna officials get.",
        "On account of the neglected wiring Amara’s personal fridge, washing machine and air conditioner have broken down.",
        "Again two weeks ago, the masonry in a portico roof broke and fell down, barely missing the children who were waiting for a bus. It is a matter of cementing it, Board Members have said although they were warned long ago.",
        "As a result, the function for which the diplomatic community was expected had to be postponed.",
        "The Bishop and his Board have advertised Amara’s position. Amara applied by the closing date in July but no action has been taken to even tell her what is going on. Perhaps the church is waiting for her contract to finish at the end of the year and for her to go. I am sure that if she is sent out, the donors will ask why. The church would then tell more lies I suppose.",
        "The Manager Rev. Philip Nesakumar says it is because she is not obedient. He also says she will turn 60 soon although they recently hired a person over 60 to Ratmalana. He and a former Principal have reportedly told the people at St. James’ Nallur that Amara is sad after her brother’s death and wants to go away. She is indeed sad but it is untrue that she wants to go away. She wants to finish the work she started and set up her charges on secure grounds.",
        "And how is she disobedient? Disobedient in refusing to agree to transfer to Ratmalana funds that Amara obtained stating that they are for Kaithady? Disobedient in declining changes to her contract after she accepted her job at Nuffield, resigned her job and sold her house in Australia and came to Sri Lanka?",
        "We are seeing the death throes of the Anglican Church in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately with the Anglican Church the Nuffield School will also die. It is a national asset and cannot be allowed to die through financial neglect and sexual predators hired by the church to be in charge of the buildings and children.",
        "As I wrote in an op-ed, if you are qualified, that makes you unqualified in the eyes of the Anglican church because you cannot be manipulated by poorly qualified clerics who get the call of God after failing their GCE O. levels. In a qualified staff member, the Bishop seems to see competition rather than a valuable resource.",
        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been duty conscious in moving the Bribery Commission into action and getting improperly obtained cars to be returned.",
        "The situation is not dissimilar in the Anglican Church. Very expensive cars have been acquired for their personal use by Bishop Kenneth Fernando, Bishop Duleep de Chickera and the archdeacons of the Colombo Diocese. De Chickera also got Rs. 900,000 to lease a van for a year from this restricted endowment fund bypassing the diocesan council.They used the Bishopric Endowment Fund without the constitutionally required consent of the Diocesan Council. There is no way the relatively poor Council Members would agree to buying luxury cars for poorly qualified priests – morally or academically or both. So the church leaderds decided to violate the church constitution and steal.",
        "The state or the Bribery Commission must be moved by the President to force the return of these stolen cars. The church preaches to the state on good governance. It should tske a small dose of it for itself. Our Bishops should learn from the crooked ministers who are returning all their improperly obtained cars. It should be more educative than an eloquent Sunday sermon.",
        "The Bribery Commission hides behind saying they have jurisdiction only over state actors but I have a paper with them showing why even private actors can be punished. With the change of the Director General of the Commission, the President should bring private crooks also under the Bribery Commission. As a matter of public interest, many of us would like to know what happened to the millions stolen from his mother’s pension fund by the Anglican Bishop Shantha Francis without informing the government of her demise. Like many things in Sri Lanka, he put his being caught on the LTTE.",
        "Far more importantly the deaf and blind children at Kaithady must be saved. All the progress there is being reversed by a non-present incompetent Board. At present a private scam is going on with hearing aids by people with no training in helping those with hearing deficiencies.",
        "When people bring complaints the church punishes them as it did Father V. Daniel of the Anglican Church’s St. John’s College who has been suspended without pay for raising union issues. When other union members questioned that, the only question was “Who told you?” When the church is evil, it is suspicious of any challenge to its authority. A government institution’s  union is safer than  church-based union. So much for Christian love!",
        "Those reporting the scam claim that children from outside the Nuffield school are being trained at the school. Amara has no knowledge of the programme. Besides, that would be a violation of Ministry Policy. Ratmalana must not be able to get its hands on the targeted grants to Tamil children in Kaithady.",
        "People are watching if President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will do anything for Tamils. He should put Bishop Dushantha Rodrigo and the crooked clerics on notice. A white cassock and a pectoral cross do not a clean heart make.",
        "But President Dissanayake can make a Nuffield child see and hear if he would force reform at the Nuffield School by getting the unsafe buildings repaired and the grant money used for the purposes for which they were donated."

        "Head Office Supports Rating: MCBSL’s rating reflects Fitch’s expectation of support, if required, from its head office of MCB Bank Limited (MCB), a large bank in Pakistan (CCC+) claiming nearly 7% of sector assets at end-2023. The rating is underpinned by MCBSL’s status as a branch of MCB, making it part of the same legal entity as MCB, subject to any regulatory constraints on MCB remitting money from Pakistan into Sri Lanka.",
        "Fitch’s assessment also takes into consideration the parent’s credit profile, which is constrained by the Pakistan sovereign on high interconnectedness, as well as MCBSL’s operational integration with MCB and the small size of its branch, at 0.9% of MCB’s total assets.",
        "Liquid Branch: MCBSL’s all currency liquidity coverage ratio of 551% at end-1H24 is supported by the branch’s large cash balance and investments in Sri Lanka treasury securities, which make nearly 51% of its total assets. We estimate that this covers around 90% of its deposit obligations. Part of its excess liquidity is also in the form of bank placements, which make up nearly 13.5% of assets.",
        "MCBSL’s liquidity position is supported by its ability to access funding from MCB, as reflected in MCB’s adequate liquidity coverage ratio of 261.9%. MCB also maintains a stable funding position, indicated by a gross loan/customer deposits ratio of around 33.0% and a net stable funding ratio of 164.9%.",
        "High Capital Buffers to Moderate: We expect MCBSL’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 65% at end-1Q24 to decline moderately over the medium term due to loan growth alongside a stabilising economy. However, the ratio is likely to remain well above the system average of 14%. The bank’s capital buffers could be vulnerable should stress exceed our expectations, due to its small absolute capital base and high concentration towards small and mid-sized corporates and rising SME exposure.",
        "Small Franchise: MCBSL’s operation in Sri Lanka is minimal, holding only 0.1% of system assets at end-1Q24. The bank’s business model focuses on riskier mid-sized and small corporate and SME borrowers. It also faces significant competition from larger banks.",
        "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",

        "A downgrade of Pakistan’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating, a weakening ability of the parent relative to the Pakistan sovereign or any other developments that affect the branch’s ability to service its obligations could also lead to a multiple-notch downgrade of MCBSL’s National Rating.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "Specialist Consultant Paediatrician and Honorary Senior Fellow, Postgraduate Institute of Medicine,",
        "In the perpetual but somewhat perplexing realm of healthcare, effective communication between healthcare providers and patients as well as the relatives and loved ones of our patients is paramount for delivering high-quality care and fostering positive patient outcomes. Central to this communication process are two verbs: “hear” and “listen”. However, while they are often used interchangeably, they denote distinct processes. These have significant implications for patient-centred care.",
        "We must probe into the distinctions of these verbs and their critical roles in patient-provider interactions to complete the embroidery of useful communication. Such phenomena should be intricately woven into the tapestry of rapport with our patients and their family members. This is ever so important as it could form the unshakeable foundation on which mutually satisfactory communication portals are established between patients and healthcare providers. It generally is the vital force that promotes human-human interaction which is at the epicentre of optimal healthcare.",
        "Understanding the crucial separation between hearing and listening is crucial to formulating satisfactory principles of communication. Hearing refers to the physiological process of perceiving sound waves through the auditory system; a kind of afferent input of thoughts and information. It is a passive, involuntary action that occurs without conscious effort. In contrast, listening actively totally transcends mere auditory perception. It involves dynamically paying attention to, interpreting, and comprehending the meaning behind the sounds or words being heard.",
        "Listening requires intentionality, focus, and empathy, to facilitate true understanding of the speaker’s message and the ever so vital context of the words that are spoken. The curious paradox of hearing but not listening carefully is most unfortunately seen more often than not, even in medical consultations. Colloquially referred to as falling on deaf ears, such a phenomenon would destroy the all-important intellectual relationship with the patient.",
        "The vital importance of listening in the context of healthcare is that listening holds profound significance for patient-centred care. When healthcare providers actively listen to their patients, they demonstrate respect, empathy, and genuine interest in understanding the patient’s concerns, preferences, and experiences. Active listening fosters trust, strengthens the patient-provider relationship, and enables shared decision-making, thereby and ultimately enhancing patient satisfaction and compliance with and adherence to the planned details of management of the illness.",
        "Despite its undoubted importance, effective listening can be impeded by various barriers in healthcare settings. Time constraints, heavy workloads, and systemic pressures may undermine the providers’ ability to allocate sufficient time and attention to listening to patients. Additionally, language barriers, cultural differences, and emotional distress on the part of either the patient or the provider can hinder meaningful communication and hamper active listening.",
        "Given the critical role of listening in patient-centred care, healthcare providers should actively cultivate and refine their listening skills by resorting to strategies that could enhance them. This would often need active efforts on the part of the healthcare personnel to develop it into a fine art. This can be achieved through training programmes, workshops, and ongoing continuous professional development initiatives focused on communication and empathetic listening.",
        "Techniques such as reflective listening, paraphrasing, and non-verbal cues such as body language, facilitate deeper understanding and rapport with patients. Out of all these vital attributes, paraphrasing; a graphic form of communication whereby one reiterates in different words what someone says, holds pride of place as it very clearly demonstrates to the patient that the healthcare provider has been intently listening to what the patient was saying. Furthermore, creating a supportive organizational culture that prioritises effective communication and allocates adequate time for patient interactions is essential for fostering a conducive environment for listening.",
        "While listening takes precedence in patient-centred communication, hearing too remains a rather indispensable and adjuvant component of a composite healthcare encounter. It plays a complementary and crucial role in the entire process of communication. Adequate and enhanced hearing abilities enable healthcare providers to detect connected but subtle cues, such as changes in a patient’s breathing patterns, eye contact avoidance, or changes in vocal tone, which may convey valuable diagnostic information. Moreover, for patients with hearing impairments or those with communication disorders, healthcare providers must adapt their communication strategies to ensure an effective exchange of information and promote inclusivity in care delivery. It is indeed a really fine art to be able to communicate with some of the people who are disadvantaged by their inability to hear or process what they hear.",
        "It must even be reiterated that in the perpetually dynamic scenery of healthcare, effective communication forms the bedrock of patient-centred care. Pivotal to this communication is the crucial form of understanding the separation between hearing and listening. While hearing represents the passive reception of sound, careful and dedicated listening embodies active engagement, understanding, and empathy.",
        "By honing their listening skills and recognising the value of both hearing and listening in patient interactions, healthcare providers can cultivate more meaningful relationships with their patients, promote shared decision-making, and ultimately, improve clinical outcomes. It is always most valuable and ever so important to listen carefully to what one is hearing through the special sense of the auditory apparatus. It may sometimes mean a lot more than what is received through the afferent acoustic pathway and the patients would absolutely adore healthcare personnel for their commitment and dedication towards their vocation.",

        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited the church during the morning and laid floral tributes at the memorial established in honor of the victims. To mark the occasion, a commemorative gift was also presented to the president.",
        "During the discussion the President met with the families of the victims, who shared their concerns and difficulties with him directly. He highlighted that the Easter Sunday Attack which happened on 21st April 2019 was the most tragic disaster in the recent past and that it will not be allowed to be buried with time.",
        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed his belief that one of the key factors influencing the people’s decision in the last presidential election was their hope for justice concerning the Easter Sunday attacks.",
        "He emphasized that the aspirations of the citizens align with his own, stating that his goal is to deliver the justice and fairness the people seek in relation to the Easter Sunday attack. He assured that efforts have already begun to achieve this, the PMD added.",
        "The President also stressed the importance of conducting the investigation without any preconceived conclusions or biases. He instructed the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security to ensure a transparent and impartial investigation, guided by openness and objectivity.",
        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake acknowledged that there is a widespread belief in society that the Easter Sunday attacks may have been carried out to gain political mileage. He stated that if hundreds of innocent lives were sacrificed for political purposes, it would be a profound tragedy. He emphasized that if politics in the country has reached such an extreme, the first priority must be to eliminate this dangerous situation.",
        "The President also highlighted growing suspicions that the government apparatus at the time may have been involved in the attacks. If such allegations are true, he warned, the country would remain in a dangerously unstable and insecure state. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to uncover the truth behind these events, he emphasized.",
        "Additionally, President Dissanayake stressed that justice must be delivered to the victims of the tragedy, which claimed the lives of nearly 274 people and left many others injured, to honor the love and devotion of their families.",
        "He also expressed his deep appreciation for the role played by the priests, who helped prevent an even greater social catastrophe in the aftermath of the attacks. The President extended his gratitude to them once again for their efforts, it said.",
        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake further stated that if the bonds, trust, and harmony within society are weakened, and people begin to view others with anger and suspicion, it would pose a serious threat to the well-being of the community. In light of this, he emphasized the need for a fair and transparent investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks.",
        "The President also noted that for the past five years, those who gathered on the streets on April 21 were driven by a hope for justice, which sustained them year after year.",
        "His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, speaking at the event, shared that despite appealing to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva for justice for the Easter Sunday victims, no resolution has been achieved. He also pointed out that while the government has been working to provide necessary support to the victims, the public continues to question the true cause of the attack.",
        "His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith expressed his belief in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, acknowledging the trust the people of Sri Lanka have in him and appreciating his integrity. He added that he believes the President will deliver on the promise of justice. He further expressed his belief that the President will take action to hold those responsible for the Easter Sunday attack accountable and ensure justice is served.",

        "“A man without ethics is a wild beast let loose upon this world.”– Albert Camus –",
        "(Address to the Ceylon College of Physicians, 19 September, 2024, Colombo, Sri Lanka)",
        "You might wonder why a scholar would opt to ask a question as seemingly banal and commonsensical as ‘where have our ethics gone’ when you, as the Ceylon College of Physicians, and others, are here to deliberate on your own intellectual, research and policy quests focused on the theme, ‘Diversity, Inclusivity and Equity.’ When I was asked to speak at this event, I was, at the same time, impacted by a serious personal crisis.",
        "It was obvious to me that it would be impossible to deal with my crisis without considering the implication of ethics and its absence in the broader sense. After all, my former university was censuring me for standing up for something I considered was a fundamental body of ethics: freedom of thought and expression on the one hand, and academic freedom on the other.  The compromise of these ethics took place in a situation my former superiors and colleagues thought they should be seen as the guardians of what they thought were the interests of the state – in this instance, India. Hence, setting out from how ethics were both impacted and compromised in this situation, and reflecting further, it became abundantly clear that without serious consideration of ethics, you, as a group of professionals, would also not be able to work in your profession, and all of us would also not be able to collectively imagine our futures as a civilization.",
        "The world we are used to and our taken-for-granted comfort zones in it would be in crisis if we moved too far away from our commitment to what we used to call ethics.  And to reiterate, I was reflecting upon this in both personal and public contexts where ethics, as I thought I understood them, had become very distant from work and life.  It is in explaining this general situation that John Berger has noted, “without ethics, man has no future. This is to say, mankind without them [ethics] cannot be itself.",
        "Ethics determine choices and actions and suggest difficult priorities.” I have referred to ethics as ‘what we used to call ethics.’ This is a very conscious choice of words on my part.  And this is because ethics in the way we used to understand them in the not-so-distant past that are still remembered by my generation and practiced by my parents until they passed on, is not how ethics are understood or practiced today. Often, it seems to me ethics is looked down upon as a reflection of foolishness and naivety, and, therefore, very casually violated, too, often without consequences. And I am not talking of our country alone, but also our region and the world.  To put it more bluntly, ethics are often seen as a liability and, therefore, something that can be done away with. This, in a sense, is my point of departure for what I have to say today.",
        "Given this situation of liminality, what would ethics constitute in its most basic sense? Within a commonsensical understanding, I suggest ethics incorporates two interrelated elements.",
        "First, ethics would mean an adherence to well-established standards of what is right and wrong. At this fundamental level, ethics would outline what people, as human beings, should do and what they should refrain from. At this level, ethics are generally understood in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, and notions of fairness. Ethics, for example, refer to those standards that impose reasonable obligations to refrain from actions that are clearly wrong, which includes, but are not limited to, rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud.",
        "But looking at Sri Lanka’s Parliament alone and the extended landscape of our local politics, individuals who commit all or many of these crimes are voted into positions of power by the people themselves.  The situation is more or less very similar in South Asia.  Against this backdrop, it almost seems as if these ethically wrong acts have become virtues.",
        "Second, as pointed out in the 1987 essay, ‘What is Ethics’ by Velasquez, Andre, Shanks, and Meyer, “ethics incorporate(s) the study and development of one’s ethical standards.” As they further note, personal “feelings, laws, and social norms can deviate from what is ethical.” Given this possibility, they remind us, “it is necessary to constantly examine one’s standards to ensure that they are reasonable and well-founded.” Ethics, in this sense then also refer to “the continuous effort of studying our own moral beliefs and our moral conduct, and striving to ensure that we, and the institutions we help to shape, live up to standards that are reasonable and solidly based.” In effect, ethics have a component of reflection through formal close examination in societies where ethics are taken seriously.  But in our context, either in schools, in universities or in other spaces of citizenship training, do we engage in this kind of reflection?",
        "This is a question I constantly asked myself and continue to ask when my own personal crisis began to unfold in my former university. The “deafening silence” of my colleagues in the midst of an unreasonable and targeted attack on me for merely standing up to a PhD student’s right to free expression and academic freedom meant that South Asian University, for which, incidentally, your tax rupees must also have been channelled as a SAARC initiative, “will never again stand for academic freedom.” As I noted in public at the time in an interview with Vidheesha Kuntamalla “the fallout of this silence and the institutionalized and choreographed timidity is that no critical and self-reflective research will ever be undertaken at the South Asian University” again. This is one small example of the long-term consequences in a single institution when ethics are deliberately placed on the back burner in the interest of mere personal convenience and gain.",
        "I want to flag three misconceptions we often have about what constitutes ethics:",
        "One,people often equate ethics with religion. The main religious traditions in our country certainly stress high ethical standards in the conduct of their adherents. But this generalization makes sense if we only focus on the doctrinal and textual positions of these religions.  However, even this cannot be sustained if we consider examples from the public and private utterances and lives of many people who claim to be religious, and particularly religious leaders.  The reduction of ethics into religion is also very dangerous because then it could also mean that only religious people would carry the burden of ethics. But we know ethics should matter in the conduct of life of both the pious and the non-believers. For sure, religion can set “high ethical standards and can provide intense motivations for ethical behaviour” (Velasquez, Andre, Shanks, and Meyer 1987).",
        "But we know from our own experience in this country, and by looking at our immediate regional neighbourhood, the first casualty in the practice of local and national politics, are usually ethics. And this compromise is often made in the name of religion.  So, reducing ethics to religion, and that, too, without proper reflection is always a grave mistake.",
        "Two, people also often believe being ethical means following the law.  Without doubt, the law is expected to incorporate ethical standards drawn from bodies of legal codes, history and civilizational memory. But laws are not always the same as ethics. Let me explain. Championed by unprincipled autocrats and adopted in dubious political climates, laws could very drastically deviate from what are ideal ethical standards for a society.",
        "The recent attempts in Sri Lanka to stifle freedom of expression under the provisions of the ICCPR Act (which is based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), and the much longer-term experience of using the Prevention of Terrorism Act for similar purposes, are classic examples. The manner in which blasphemy laws in Pakistan have been drafted and applied historically is another example. Similarly, ‘National Security’ Laws, ‘Anti-Terrorism’ Laws and elements of the Public Safety Act have been used in India to repress dissent and to suspend fundamental rights, particularly of minorities in specific situations.",
        "So, in these situations, when laws themselves are proven to be unethical in their application, the ethical position would be the commitment to change these laws and not to become subsumed by their erroneous logic.",
        "Three, many of us also believe that being ethical means adhering to what society considers acceptable.  It is generally correct that most of us would accept societal standards and norms that are ethical. Our respect towards elders is one such position. But standards of behaviour in any society can deviate from what is ideally ethical to not only to what is simply unethical, but also clearly tyrannical. It is not an exaggeration to say that “an entire society can become ethically corrupt” under specific historical conditions (Velasquez, Andre, Shanks, and Meyer 1987). To use a personal example, whatever society’s ideals are, caste, religious and ethnic discrimination is strictly not possible for me.  I have never engaged in such discrimination, and I never will. It is about adhering to an ethical principle, irrespective of society’s dominant trends.  The way in which draconian social and political orders have been planned, implemented and broadly accepted by some societies is a classic example of an entire society becoming ethically compromised.  Nazi Germany and South Africa, under apartheid, are two recent examples.",
        "What concerns me, as a person, as a citizen, as an inhabitant of the planet, and I think the least important in this context, as a scholar, is that ‘ethics’, as an idea and as a set of good practices, as understood above, have lapsed from the commonsense in our country; in our extended geopolitical neighbourhood; and, in varying degrees, in the world we live in.  For those of my generation, the value of ethics came from our parents which they had learnt as part of their colonial education and as part of their citizenship training to be good colonial subjects. Whatever other failures that education might have had due to the very imprint of coloniality and its necessary brutality, it did give a very strong sense of ethics within the colonial framework.",
        "But even after independence, aspects of that education and the ethics that came with it, held sway as a central preoccupation of many people in my parents’ generation.  For people like my father who was a government surveyor, my mother who was a school teacher and my father-in-law who was a civil servant – just to take three personal examples – doing anything wrong, and therefore unethical, was simply unthinkable.  But their principled positions, at times, did have negative personal consequences.  While there were examples to the contrary, even at that time, there was a strong sense of what they called the ‘right thing.’  This was their reference to ethics. But today, that quotidian emphasis is not something that is easily seen. Our present-day education system does not seem to place too much conscious emphasis on ethics.  I am also not sure if this is even done within the family as it used to be. It seems to me, in this time and age, being ethical is understood as depriving oneself of economic, social and political opportunities.",
        "This rupture of ethics, its distancing from day-to-day life, is most clearly manifest in our politics at all levels. It is not that an old set of ethics has been deliberately replaced by a new one. It is more like ethics have been overdetermined by what I would call ‘non-ethics.’ That is, a discourse on power, money, avarice and influence has made adherence to ethics and reflection on ethics immaterial, relegating them to a position of insignificance and relative erasure.",
        "You may think that I am being unreasonably dreamy, and too idealistic, and our world still knows about ethics, and that I simply do not see it.  I have actually been told this before. But to me, the problem is not that we do not know about ethics today, but that we do not allow ethics to blossom as an integral part of our lives, and rule our lives, work and conscience.  The problem with ethics anywhere historically is that they tend to be very fragile and are usually among the first casualties in any condition of catastrophe or challenge.",
        "In my monologue today, I have not tried to provide you with ideal answers.  To provide answers to such complex questions is not the role of a sociologist.  That is the job of self-proclaimed religious gurus with divine connections, know-it-all politicians we may or may not believe in and certainly street corner magicians.  My job and that of others like me is to simply situate problems in context and explore what is possible and what is at stake. That, I think I have done.",
        "As you begin your deliberations within the theme, ‘Diversity, Inclusivity and Equity,’ you may also want to consider why you came up with this theme in the first place in this time and age when these three principles should already be well ingrained in the way we think and work.  But if you were concerned enough to bring this up as a theme, perhaps we share the same anxieties about ethics in our society and work environments, and what our collective futures may look like.",
        "The final question you may wish to ask yourselves is, where would our youth learn and be inspired by ethics that can rebuild a decent world for them.  It certainly cannot come from the life lessons imparted by political leaders and publicly vocal religious leaders of our time. There is a vast difference between what is preached by them and what is actually done. For me, this dichotomy is a cartography of the collective failure in our times. This is what Bertrand Russell meant when he noted, “we have in fact, two kinds of morality, side by side: one which we preach but do not practice, and another which we practice, but seldom preach.”",
        "My request and suggestion is that we can no longer bank on politics or religion to re-invent our disappearing sense of ethics for the future.  We also cannot hope for divine intervention or anticipate that someone else in the form of a local superman or superwoman, or in Sri Lanka’s case a super reptile rising from the depths of a sanctified river will resolve our problems.",
        "It can only come from individuals, like us, whose only vested interest should be our own stake in an ethically sound collective future, and to bring that urgency to our families, workplaces and the wider public sphere.",

The venue for this cultural event is the Art Gallery of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Jaffna. The exhibition which began on January 30 will continue until February 9.",
        "The backdrop of the exhibition is rooted in the historical and cultural landscape of Northern Sri Lanka, where the 19th-century Tamil Christian Art and Architecture laid the foundation for a unique regional identity. Influenced and fortified by traditional Hindu religious practices, this phenomenon gave rise to a distinctive blend of art, architecture, folklore, and rituals.The heart of the exhibition lies in its vibrant posters, each narrating a story of Hindu-Catholic encounters, cross-cultural responsiveness evident in places of worship, and the architectural models and interior elements linked to the Cochin and Malabar traditions of India and the vernacular architecture of Northern Sri Lanka. The tapestry of intercultural integration comes alive through sacred images, religious paintings, and liturgical fixtures that encapsulate the essence of the unexposed Tamil Christian artistic phenomenon.",
        "As visitors walk through the exhibition, they will be captivated by colourful stories that bridge the gap between the remnants of the past and present-day distractions. Architect Jayasinghe, the visionary behind this cultural journey, has meticulously crafted an experience that transcends time, allowing viewers to delve into the layers of history and heritage that define the Tamil Christian artistic expression.",
        "The exhibition, inaugurated on January 29 by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Jaffna, Prof. S.Srisathunarajah, corresponded with the opening session of the International Conference on “Tamil Christian Art Worlds.” This collaborative effort between the Department of Fine Arts of the University of Jaffna and the Post Graduate and Research Department of Folklore of St. Xavier’s College, Tamil Nadu, South India, sets the stage for an exploration of the intricate connections between art, religion, and culture. The exhibition is supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., within the scope of the ARTIS-IHA Base Funding project.",
        "Architect Jayasinghe, the driving force behind the “Cultural Mosaic”, is a practising architect and a fellow member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects. With a research focus on cultural heritage, missionary movements, and ecclesiastical art and architecture in Sri Lanka, Jayasinghe has established himself as a leading expert in the field. His dedication is evident through a decade of contributions, including published books, exhibitions, conference papers, public lectures, and journal articles in both local and global contexts. He was currently serving as the Honourary Secretary of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Sri Lanka and an Expert Member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Places of Religion and Ritual.",
        "In conclusion, the “Cultural Mosaic” exhibition is an invitation to embark on a journey through time, culture, and art. It is a celebration of the intricate threads that weave together the diverse elements of Tamil Christian artistic expression, creating a tapestry that reflects the resilience and beauty of cultural integration of the island’s northern region."

        "The Lanka Sama Samaja Party [LSSP] was formed in 1935 with two main objectives – winning independence from British imperial rule and eliminating poverty and gaining social equity for all the people of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). There was a list of 22 other issues like a free health service, free education, employees’ rights etc.",
        "The struggle for independence led to the banning of the LSSP and the imprisonment of its leaders like Dr. N M Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Philip Gunewardena and many others, both in Sri Lanka, and in India where they went underground after escaping from jail here.",
        "Leslie Goonewardene led the underground struggle against the British, who finally granted us independence in 1948. They left, but retained control of the plantations, and the King (later Queen) of Britain retained sovereignty. Full independence with sovereignty was obtained after 24 years of struggle led by the LSSP (as the local capitalist class and the feudalists were satisfied with Dominion status). It was only in 1972, through the Republican Constitution drawn up by Colvin, which made Sri Lanka a fully independent and sovereign Republic. India won independence in just three years through struggles led by Gandhi and Nehru, with the full support of their capitalist class.",
        "It was Colvin, who as Minister of Plantations, with the support of Kobbekaduwa, who nationalized the plantations, thereby getting full control of our economy. It was the LSSP that formed most of the trade unions that struggled and won workers rights and fair wages. They had to have frequent strikes to support these struggles for rights and proper wages. The strength of the trade unions gave the LSSP the necessary support for the political struggles. The unions were also the recruiting grounds for new party members.",
        "A bulk of the members came from different districts. The party was started in the Kegalle district by Dr.N M Perera and while the party has 270 branches in all 25 districts, Kegalle is its stronghold. As such the Ruwanwella and Yatiyantota electorates are the strongest and the LSSP has won seats at all levels up to Parliament at every election. Deraniyagala has been lost only once. Yatiyantota came to be called “the N M electorate”.",
        "The next in strength for the LSSP is the southern coastal strip extending from Colombo to Galle districts, with representatives up to Parliament including Moratuwa, Panadura, Kalutara, Balapitiya, Ambalangoda, and Ratgama. Extending inland from this area the LSSP has won Matugama, Agalawatte, and Bandaragama.",
        "In Colombo too LSSP had members of Parliament from Wellawatte-Galkissa (Colvin) Colombo South (Bernard Soysa), Colombo North (Vivienne Gunewardena), Colombo East and Borella. There were MPs from Badulla, Bandarawela, Nuwara Eliya and Maskeliya in the hill country. There were Tamil MPs from Jaffna in the North and from Batticaloa District. The LSSP is free of any prejudice based on race, religion or caste.",
        "All these MPs, MMCs etc have worked day and night for the people they represented. Not one of them has ever had any charges of misdeeds lodged against them in any Court of Law. None have obtained or misused any Government money or buildings. Rather than using Government property or funds for themselves or relatives or friends, they have spent their own money to help others in need. They have never charged a cent for any services rendered by them. This is a proud record that has been upheld by all LSSP politicians. We are committed to serve the people and the country. You can rely on us at all times.",

        "ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is likely to miss the 2024 target on the excise tax as production has reduced compared to the last year with the liquor prices having risen amid increase in illicit liquor manufacturing, a top Excise Department official said.",

        "“According to the trend, this year it will be around 31-32 million liters. There is a 30 percent increase in illicit liquor as the prices of liquor have risen in the last two years,” Gunasiri told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.",
        "“There is around 3 million liters of excess ethanol. It is obvious that there is a production drop. We might reach 215 billion rupees. We are trying our best to get it to 220 billion.”",

        "இத் தேர்தல் மூலம் ஜனாதிபதியாக வருபவர், தமிழர்கள் தேர்தலைப் புறக்கணித்ததன் விளைவாகவே தன்னால் சனாதிபதியாக வெற்றிபெற முடிந்தது என்ற நிலைமையையும் - தோற்றவர்கள், தமிழ் மக்களின் தீர்வு தொடர்பாக நம்பிக்கையை கொடுத்திருந்தால் தங்களால் வென்றிருக்க முடியும் என்ற ஏக்கத்தையும் உருவாக்கும்.",

        "Speaking at a National People’s Power (NPP) rally in Vavuniya over the weekend, Dissanayake emphasised that, unlike in the past, this move would not face opposition from the South, as the nation now stands united under the NPP banner.",
        "“There was a war in the North, causing great destruction. But there are political prisoners who remain. On the AG’s advice, we are ready to take necessary steps for their release. Will the South object? No, as today we have a united South,” Dissanayake affirmed.",
        "He noted that previous Governments might have faced resistance due to divisive politics, but the NPP’s inclusive vision has won the trust of all communities, Sinhalese, Muslims, and Tamils alike, uniting them under one flag.",
        "At the rally, the President also addressed the issue of land ownership, a divisive matter often creating tensions between Northern and Southern communities. He confirmed the Government’s commitment to returning lands in the North, which were previously taken over for security purposes, to their rightful owners.",
        "“When land was allocated to the North, there was once an outcry from the South, and vice versa. But leadership that represents all communities can resolve these issues,” Dissanayake remarked, expressing confidence that a united approach will lead to a future where resources and rights are equitably shared, fostering national unity.",
        "Additionally, Dissanayake also made a bold pledge to defend the rights of Northern fishermen, whose livelihoods have long been threatened by Indian poachers. He noted that poaching activities in areas like Pesalai, Mannar, have led to the overharvesting of fish stocks and damage to breeding grounds through destructive fishing practices.",
        "“We will take every step necessary to protect the rights of the Northern fisher community. If we fail, they will think that Southern Governments do not care for them. We must therefore strengthen their security,” he said.",
        "The President also announced plans to review existing contracts with private companies over solar energy projects, expressing concern that sunlight, a vital renewable resource, is being commercialised under unfair terms.",
        "“Sunlight is the source of all creation, and now it is being treated as a mere commodity. This sunlight is our power, and we will not allow it to be sold cheaply,” Dissanayake said. He emphasised the Government’s commitment to ensuring that renewable resources like solar energy serve national development and benefit the people directly."

        "Addressing the High Cost of Shoes As the cost of living continues to rise, an often-overlooked burden falls on families struggling to afford school uniforms for their children.",
        "Among these uniform components, school shoes have become almost unaffordable for many parents, prompting a call for urgent reforms to the current school uniform policy.",
        "In Sri Lanka, it is common for children to wear the same pair of shoes for multiple years, despite their feet continuing to grow. This practice, born out of necessity, can have detrimental effects on children’s foot health and overall well-being.",
        "The issue is further exacerbated by the economic struggles that many families face, forcing parents to prioritize other essentials over new, properly fitting shoes for their children.",
        "The current regulations surrounding school uniforms, which mandate specific types of footwear, are increasingly out of step with the economic realities faced by a significant portion of the population. The rigid enforcement of these rules fails to consider the financial strain placed on families, particularly those with multiple school-going children.",
        "A practical solution to this growing problem is to relax the regulations regarding school shoes. Allowing students to wear low-cost, breathable footwear would alleviate the financial burden on parents while also addressing the health needs of the children.",
        "Breathable shoes, in particular, are essential for maintaining foot health, as they help prevent issues such as fungal infections, blisters, and discomfort, which can arise from wearing ill-fitting or non-breathable shoes over extended periods. Implementing this change would have several benefits:",
        "1. Economic Relief for Families: By permitting more affordable footwear options, parents would be able to allocate their limited resources more effectively. This change would especially benefit low-income families, who are disproportionately affected by the high costs of school uniforms.",
        "2. Improved Foot Health for Students: Shoes that fit properly and allow feet to breathe are crucial for children’s physical development. Relaxing the regulations would enable parents to choose footwear that supports healthy growth and reduces the risk of foot-related health issues.",
        "3. Enhanced Focus on Education: When children are comfortable and healthy, they are better able to focus on their studies. Reducing the stress associated with uniform costs and improving physical comfort can contribute to a more conducive learning environment.",
        "4. Greater Inclusivity: Updating the uniform policy to be more inclusive of various economic backgrounds would foster a sense of equality and understanding among students.",
        "It would acknowledge the diverse financial circumstances of families across Sri Lanka. To facilitate this transition, schools could provide guidelines on acceptable footwear that emphasize affordability and health rather than strict uniformity.",
        "Community outreach and awareness campaigns could help parents understand the benefits of the new policy and how to select appropriate shoes for their children.",
        "In conclusion, the need for urgent reforms to the school uniform policy, particularly regarding footwear, is clear. By allowing low-cost, breathable shoes, we can provide much-needed economic relief to parents, ensure the health and comfort of students, and promote a more inclusive and equitable education system.",
        "The time to act is now, and we urge the relevant authorities to consider these changes for the betterment of our children and society as a whole.",
        "This article aims to highlight the pressing need for changes in the school uniform policy to better accommodate the financial and health needs of students and their families. The suggested reforms are not only practical but also essential in ensuring that all children have the opportunity to thrive in their educational environment.",

        "The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to China’s aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body.",
        "Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president’s ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters.",
        "Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women’s prison.",
        "In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks.",
        "When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. “Don’t worry about my security because I’ve talked with somebody. I said ‘if I’m killed, you’ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,’” the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president.",
        "“I’ve given my order, ‘If I die, don’t stop until you’ve killed them.’ And he said, ‘yes,’” the vice president said.",
        "Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan “with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority.”",
        "“We call for calm and resolve,” Brawner said. “We reiterate our need to stand together against those who will try to break our bonds as Filipinos.”",
        "The vice president is the daughter of Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drugs crackdown when he was a city mayor and later as president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity.",
        "The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements. He told a public Philippine Senate inquiry last month that he had maintained a “death squad” of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of southern Davao city."

Kumarapperuma explained that publishing State secrets is a criminal offence, and if the reports Gammanpila intends to release are classified under the law, it could have serious consequences.",
        "“There are several reports related to the Easter attacks, including the Presidential Commission report and the Parliamentary Select Committee report. A Presidential Commission report cannot be made public for 30 years, according to the law, and can only be accessed by the President,” Kumarapperuma said.

        "Regardless of Sri Lanka’s past status as a colony of the UK, this columnist is inclined to the view that Sri Lanka’s post-colonial ties with Great Britain have, on the whole, been very wholesome and productive. The UK has been mainly instrumental, of course, in introducing Sri Lanka to Western civilization and culture and although opinions may differ locally on whether this has proved a good or a bad thing, any impartial observer would be compelled to concede that the UK’s continuing cultural influence in Sri Lanka in particular has accrued more to the latter’s benefit than to its detriment.",
        "The beneficial influence continuing to be wielded by the British Council Library on Sri Lanka, alone, clinches the point. It could be unhesitatingly stated that higher education in the Humanities and the arts, in particular, is impossible in Sri Lanka without the sustenance and support of the British Council Library. It is a resource base that just cannot be ignored by those aspiring to be educationally well-rounded men or women.",
        "Moreover, the English Language is currently the widest used international language and is crucial to the conduct of global relations in a multiplicity of spheres. Truly, it may be said that minus the English Language a self-sufficient existence for countries is inconceivable today.",
        "Thanks to the Library’s English Language teaching programs, quite a number of local primary and secondary school students are being enabled to be proficient in English. In an assessment of how the Library is benefiting Sri Lanka, these teaching programs should not be glossed over.",
        "The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to be held in Samoa in October ought to prompt the governments and publics of the UK’s former colonies to re-assess the importance of Britain in their foreign policy thinking and to reflect deeply on the foregoing things.",
        "Thus far, the British Commonwealth of Nations has remained largely intact as a collectivity of mainly the South and this fact testifies to the continuing relevance of the Commonwealth and it usefulness, for Britain’s former colonies in particular. All things considered, the latter have found it advisable to remain within the Commonwealth fold.",
        "The British Commonwealth’s continued existence and vibrancy is also proof of the ‘balanced’ nature of British foreign policy; a factor that H.C. Patrick thought it fit to stress. This aspect of British foreign policy should be considered as being manifested in the comparatively unobtrusive character of the UK’s dealings with the rest of the world. It does not follow from this premise that Britain would not be forceful in its international relations in matters that touch crucially on what it sees as its best interests. It cannot be otherwise.",
        "H.C. Patrick’s subsequent comments to the effect that the UK was seeking to re-connect with the EU and other global players that matter needed to be seen as reflecting the UK’s efforts at conducting a ‘balanced foreign policy’. That is, these initiatives are an extension of the current UK foreign policy of maintaining an equidistance, so to speak, between it and other global powers.",
        "Among other notable ‘takes’ from the H.C.’s presentation was the comment that Britain is placing an emphasis on strengthening its ties with India. This is welcome news for the democracies of South Asia in particular in view of India’s growing stature as a global ‘Swing State.’ It is only those democratic powers that are capable of influencing world developments in a beneficial direction that are credited with a ‘Swing’ status and growing positive ties between India and Britain are bound to be welcomed by democratic opinion the world over as presaging a global power balance more in favour of the world’s democracies.",
        "On the economic development front, what was of principal interest for the developing world in the H.C.’s presentation was his mention that the UK’s Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) has now come to replace the Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP), which had hitherto played a pivotal role in regulating developing countries’ access to UK export markets.",
        "From the Sri Lankan viewpoint in particular what would be of importance in this context is that, for instance, Sri Lanka would have improved access to the UK market. Specifically, some 99 percent of its exports would be eligible to zero tariffs. Needless to say, this is a considerable boon for a struggling economy.",
        "Besides the above ‘positive spinoffs’ on the cultural and economic fronts for Southern states, such as Sri Lanka, from improved ties with the UK, the South would also do well to study long and deep Britain’s Race Relations Act, which has over the decades helped it considerably in effectively managing its identity conflicts. While it is true that Britain is no stranger to racial violence, it is equally true that it is also home to a vibrant Anti-Racism Movement that springs into action in the face of such disturbances. The mentioned legislation apparently goes some distance in motivating the public to say ‘No’ to race hate.",
        "Sri Lanka has been plagued for long decades by racial violence but has to date done nothing constructive to bring it within manageable limits. Legislation on the lines of the UK’s Race Relations Act would enable Sri Lanka to manage its race relations better and lay a durable basis for sustainable development which is inconceivable without internal peace and harmony.",

The partnership began with a pilot programme aimed at empowering 250 underprivileged students from low-income schools in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, 60 teachers from schools and community centres also received specialised training. The initiative is designed to develop essential skills such as listening, speaking and thinking in students to help boost their confidence and prepare them for success in the future.",
        "As part of this programme, students and teachers from 18 schools in the Serendib Schools Development Foundation (SSDF), St. Anthony’s Balika, Dematagoda and selected trainers from the Foundation of Goodness participated in an intensive training programme which took place at the Khairiya Muslim Girls College over a period of one week.",
        "The programme concluded with a competition that saw students showcasing what they had learned. The overall goal of this initiative is to equip students with valuable skills and to inspire the wider communities to believe that anyone can learn these essential life skills. The Debate Mate Team in charge of training students, teachers and facilitating the competition included Abby McGovern, Elissa Abbara, Sidharth Harigovind, Dale Connelan and Alia Chohan, who flew in from London.",
        "The partnership between Learn for Life Lanka and Debate Mate was formed based on a shared vision to enrich the skills of local students. Debate Mate is an employability programme that leverages debating to teach students essential skills. The programme has impacted over 65,000 young people around the world, and helps develop critical thinking, creativity, empathy, resilience, leadership, teamwork and confidence. Debate Mate’s training programme is also looking into the possibilities of spreading its global expertise further by training corporate employees in Sri Lanka as well.",

        "With the Elections Commission now on formal record that the forthcoming presidential election must be held on a date between Sept. 17 and Oct. 16, 2024, the attention of both the media and the electorate will inevitably become more focused on the upcoming contest. While incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is serving former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s balance term which ends on Nov. 19, has not yet declared his own candidature, his intimates have positively stated that he is a runner.",
        "Much that is happening in the political space right now are pointers in that direction. The common perception at this point of time is that the three principal contenders will be Wickremesinghe, who is trying to cobble together a broad alliance to back him and is ulikely to run under UNP colours, Sajith Premadasa of the SJB and Anura Kumara Dissanayake to the NPP/JVP.",
        "The ruling Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has remained remarkably shy of saying whether they are backing Wickremesinghe, who GR first appointed prime minister and SLPP then elected to serve GR’s balance term, or whether they have any other candidate in mind. Though MR has said that son Namal has “more time,” the dynastic ambitions of the Rajapaksas are no secret and Namal has not ruled himself out of the running. Other functionaries of the purple sataka (originally kurakkan) brigade often say they will reveal their candidate at the “right time.”",
        "Billionaire businessman Dhammika Perera, who entered parliament taking Basil Rajapsksa’s national list seat and briefly served as GR’s Minister of Investment Promotion in June-July 2022 also harbors presidential ambitions. He has barely opened his mouth in parliament since his appointment to the legislature but recently made public appearances in the SLPP May Day rally and later at the opening of that partyt’s election office at Nelun Mawatha to which party organizers had been summoned. On both occasions he was clad in his trademark blue suit and red tie, looking quite the puduma satha among the political hoi polloi present at the events. Perera also appeared at one of his own DP Education events at the Nelun Pokuna theatre alongside both MR and RW. The presence of Wickremesinghe at a Dhammika Perera show was a rare occurrence.",
        "As Dr. Nihal Jayawickrema, the respected lawyer and academic, wrote in this newspaper last Sunday, the constitution is very clear on when a presidential election must be held. As such he expressed puzzlement on why a widely viewed television news channel persisted with the refrain “When’s the election?” However that may be, the Elections Commission either on its own initiative or for some other reason like media inquiries, made a formal announcement of the period during which the presidential election must be held stopping short of naming a day. Observers point out that the Commission had stated the obvious despite not being under any obligation to do so.",
        "One possible reason for this could be Mr. Basil Rajapaksa’s continuing pressure on the president to call a general election before a presidential contest. It is very well known that the constitution enables the president to dissolve an incumbent parliament two and a half years after its election. Given that the sitting legislature was elected in August 2020, and that time period has now elapsed, Wickremesinghe, if he wishes, can dissolve parliament and an election must be held thereafter. But he has been resisting the SLPP demand for an early parliamentary election.",
        "It is fairly clear why Basil Rajapaksa, the founder of the SLPP wishes to have a parliamentary election before a presidential race. If whatever horse the SLPP backs, be it Wickremesinghe or any other, his/her defeat will cost votes at the parliamentary election due by August 2025. Of course any parliamentary election in the short term is possible not only by the grace and favor of the president but also by law. A resolution passed with a simple majority in the 225-member legislature any time now, that is with 113 votes, will compel an election.",
        "The SLPP at present commands that majority. But the current picture is that a number of its MPs do not favor an early parliamentary election for various reasons. Among these is that first timers in the legislature will not qualify for a pension if they have not completed five years of parliamentary service. Also, there are those MPs who doubt their own re-election prospects and would prefer to serve the full term in the incumbent legislature rather than face a premature poll. So whatever Basil Rajapaksa’s wishes and calculations are, the required numbers will not be possible without the backing of sections of the opposition. That is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
        "Apart from the three main contender identified earlier, there are other hopefuls who will throw their hats into the ring as demonstrated in previous presidential elections. Also, many ‘dummy’ candidates are usually run by serious contenders looking for their candidate privileges. Various formations are taking place at present, hints and speculation abound and there will be more to follow between now and the actual polling date which is likely to be announced some time in July.",
        "While aspirants abound, most of them will do as badly as similar runners for the presidency have done in the past. But all kinds of games including some comedies are afoot and the country must await further developments in the not too distant future.",

        "India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish",
        "The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, most of the toughest policies that were needed for Sri Lanka to achieve macroeconomic stability were already put in place by the former President Ranil Wickremesinghe when the IMF program was approved. But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public",
        "The Maldives is close to an economic crisis similar to which unfolded in Sri Lanka in 2022. The government of Muizzu came to power with an “India Out” campaign. But today, as was the case for Sri Lanka in 2022, when Maldives is in deep economic trouble and is close to defaulting, it is India that has come to its aid. India could have very well looked the other way but it didn’t. This should be a clear message for South Asian nations that they can have many best friends but India will remain the brother who will come to their help when things go bad.",
        "What most people in Sri Lanka do not realise is that India started rolling out its financial assistance totalling $ 4 billion (over the year) in January 2022 itself. Most of India’s $ 4 billion in 2022 came when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the President. In January 2022, the situation for Sri Lanka was dark. Sri Lanka needed to pay $ 6.9 billion by the end of 2022 and it only had $ 1.6 billion in reserves. Sri Lanka was shut out of international capital markets. It was staring at a default and the Government at that time was refusing to go to the IMF. Many other countries would have refrained from sending money to Sri Lanka in January 2022 as there was a strong possibility that that money would not be paid back any time soon. But still India went ahead and helped Sri Lanka.",
        "The IMF program is to give Sri Lanka $ 3 billion over four years with conditions. India gave $ 4 billion in one year to Sri Lanka with no conditions. Also, the timing is important to note. The IMF program came in 2023 when Sri Lanka had stabilised to a large extent under President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

But India came to Sri Lanka’s aid when Sri Lanka was staring at the abyss with a Government that was behaving very irrationally in January 2022 with the country facing macroeconomic instability. This point should not be forgotten by the Sri Lankan public.",
        "An IMF program is essential for Sri Lanka as the IMF is not about the $3 billion it gives but the verification it brings. The IMF is like an auditor which brings trust to the nation back. World Bank and ADB funding is linked to the IMF and so are debt restructuring with many creditors. India was instrumental in making it easier for Sri Lanka to enter the IMF program. As a former minister was saying that the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva had told him, that when the Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had met the IMF chief, the Indian Finance Minister had spent over 75% of her time speaking for Sri Lanka and only 25% of her time speaking about India. This shows the care and effort India placed in pushing the IMF to support Sri Lanka. India was also the first country to give financing assurance to the IMF for Sri Lanka and was one of the three key members of the Official creditor Committee along with France and Japan.",
        "A fact that is not mentioned much is the decision of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in helping Sri Lanka. In January 2022, the Indian Prime Minister was two years away from reelection and in India there are many state elections in any given year in which his party, the BJP contests. Providing $ 4 billion to Sri Lanka is a large amount. PM Modi could have very well directed it towards domestic projects. For example, one of PM Modi’s flagship projects under his Production linked incentive scheme (PLI) was where the Indian government gave $ 2 billion worth of subsidies to Micron Technology to produce semiconductors in Gujarat which was to create 5,000 direct jobs and 15,000 indirect jobs.",
        "PM Modi could have easily been tempted to initiate two more projects like Micron in India which could have increased his votes rather than help Sri Lanka with $ 4 billion (which is twice the amount the Indian government directed towards Micron). Putting the well being of Sri Lankans even above domestic interests by the Indian government should not be forgotten by Sri Lankans.",
        "Lastly, what many Sri Lankans need to realise is that $ 4 billion is much more significant for India than for the other bilateral creditors like Japan or even China. India is a lower middle income country and GDP per capita terms, Sri Lanka is still richer than India. In an imaginary situation, let’s say China (as it’s the largest bilateral creditor) and India both provided $ 4 billion in assistance for argument’s sake. China’s economy is almost five times larger than India’s so India’s assistance of $ 4 billion as a proportion of its economic size would be five times more valuable than $ 4 billion from China.",
        "India’s help was significant at a crucial time as Sri Lanka was going through a nightmarish situation in 2022. It is a good time for Sri Lankans to reflect on this crucial bilateral relationship with our neighbour to the north. The way forward does not have to be based on gratitude alone but more on opportunity. India is the fastest growing large economy in the world and soon set to be the third largest economy in the world. India’s middle class alone is set to hit 500 million which is an opportunity for Sri Lankan businesses. Sri Lanka is a country that is known to not miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The next big opportunity for Sri Lanka is to our north and hope we do not miss this.",

        "Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayakam was born  in Ipoh Malaysia on 31st March 1898. His Birth centenary year begins tomorrow. He was from Thellippalai in Jaffna. His father Visvanathan Veluppillai was a businessman in Malaysia. SJV’s mother Harriet Annamma’s maiden name was Kanapathippillai.",
        "When Chelvanayakam was four years of age the family with the exception  of his father moved back to Thellippalai so that the children could obtain a good education.SJV a protestant christian attended Union College Thellippalai, St. John’s College Jaffna and finally St. Thomas’ College Mt. Lavinia (located at Mutwal then) Later his first cousin Anandanayagam became Warden of the same institution. At STC Chelvanayakam was a  contemporary of SWRD Bandaranaike with whom he was to cross swords politically many a time later.",
        "Chelvanayakam first graduated as an external student of the London University. He got a B Sc. He then began teaching at ST. Thomas’s College Mt. Lavinia. Later he moved to Wesley College as a teacher. While teaching he pursued studies in law and soon enrolled himself as an Advocate of the Supreme Court. He confined himself to Civil matters mainly and built up a lucrative practice. He became a respected civil lawyer and took silk in due course.",
        "In 1927 he married Emily Grace Barr Kumarakulasinghe the daughter of RR Barr Kumarakulasinghe the “Maniaghar” (Administrative Chief) of Thellippalai. He donned the Tamil national dress Verti and Salvai at his wedding instead of western attire as was customary of the English educated  Elite then.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s love for the Tamil language and Tamil culture was not an artificiality constructed for political purposes. It was more a deep-seated natural emotion. Even before entering politics he would always refer to himself as a man from Jaffna. He wore the Verti at home as far as possible. Except on legal or official business or at mixed social gatherings he always conversed with fellow Tamils in Tamil. Although not a scholar he was also familiar with ancient Tamil literature. Chelvanayakam was also extremely appreciative of Carnatic music and Bharatha Natyam.",
        "What is remarkable about this affinity for Tamil culture on the part of Chelvanayakam was his equally committed conviction and adherence to his Christian beliefs and faith. He was a practising member of the Church of South India,  Jaffna Diocese. In Colombo he attended the Anglican Church but after the CSI opened a Church in Wellawatte opted to worship at that Church more. His Christianity inspired his political mission.",
        "Although his Christian names were Samuel and James the Biblical figure that had great impact on him was Moses. Chelva saw himself as some kind of latter-day Moses whose mission was to deliver his persecuted people from political slavery into the promised land of milk and honey.",
        "In fact at Chelvanayakam’s memorial service at the CSI Church in Wellawatte Bishop DJ Ambalavanar delivered a moving Eulogical sermon under the text”Let my People Go”. The Biblical verses invoked were from the Old Testament pertaining to Moses, Pharaoh and the Israelites in Egypt.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s political colleagues have noted that at times of doubt and indecision about certain political issues Chelva would retire quietly for meditation and prayer. This strengthened his will and reinforced his resolve. Once he arrived at a decision after prayer he would stick to it firmly and would not yield to any compromise thereafter.",
        "Despite this Christian Conviction he had also absorbed much of the Hindu ethos having grown up in a predominantly Saivite environment. Also many of his close relatives were Hindus. His attachment to Tamil culture also nurtured an affinity towards the Hindu Ethos. This enabled him to claim to those near and dear to him that he was a Christian by religion and a Hindu by culture.",
        "Again it must be emphasised that this was not an affected position caused by political expediency. SJV Chelvanayakam’s Parliamentary constituency Kankesanthurai as well as the Sri Lankan Tamil people in their entirety were predominantly Hindu. Although Chelvanayakam had an empathy towards his fellow Hindu Tamils it was not something cooked up to cultivate political support. This was something inculcated in him long before even thinking of embarking on a political career.",
        "The reality was that he never compromised on his religious principles for political gain. His “ Christianity” was used against him by political opponents time and again. His Tamil political rivals raised the religious cry overtly and covertly many times on both electoral and national levels. He was portrayed as the Christian outsider trying to usurp rightful Hindu leadership. In 1952 it was stridently harped upon when the Federal party first faced the hustings. After 1956 no Tamil politician of any standing dared to raise the anti-Christian cry against him openly but covert whisper campaigns were afoot.",
        "The only exception perhaps was Prof C. Sunderalingam during the elections of 1970. Sunderalingam had spearheaded the anti-temple entry movement at the historic Maviddapuram Kandaswamy temple in 1968. His role had gained him the support of many caste conscious upper caste Hindus of the area which fell under the Kankesanthurai electorate.",
        "SJV and the Federal party had generally kept aloof of the controversy but had extended moral support to those so-called low caste Tamils demanding the right of entry into the temple. Sunderalingam hoped to cash in on the resentment in conservative Tamil circles over Chelvanayakam’s non-involvement in the issue despite being the MP. So he whipped up a nakedly anti- Christian campaign against Chelvanayakam.",
        "An aggressive aspect of that campaign was Sunderalingam driving up to any group of bystanders in the electorate and exhibiting a silver “VEL” (a javelin like weapon in the hands of Lord Muruga) and a wooden cross. He would hold them aloft and ask loudly “Vela?Siluvaia?” meaning do you want the Vel (Hindu) or Cross (Christian) The overwhelmingly Hindu voters of KKS elected Chelvanayakam that year in a fitting reply.",
        "Chelvanayakam held the Kankesanthurai constituency from 1947 to 1977 with two breaks in between. The first was from 1952 to 1956 when he lost to S.Natesapillai of the UNP. The second was from 1972 October to Feb 1975 when he resigned his seat and challenged Mrs. Bandaranaike’s government to hold a by-election as a means of testing whether the Tamil people accepted the 1972 constitution or not. After postponing the elections for a long time the Government held it finally in 1975 where the Kankesanthurai voters re-elected Chelvanayakam with a thumping majority of more than 16,000 votes.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s only electoral defeat was in 1952. The Federal Party had just emerged and the Tamil voters were not that enamoured of its policies then. GG Ponnambalam a minister in the UNP government was still the dominant figure in Tamil politics.Chelvanayakam as the leader of the fledgeling party was constrained to campaign more in other electorates where the party fielded candidates than in his own.",
        "Moreover it was an open secret that Natesapillai if elected was certain to become a UNP Minister. These were all reasons in favour of Natesapillai (son-in-law of Sir P Ramanathan) being elected. In addition to this the religious card was also used against Chelvanayakam publicly and privately.",
        "During the campaign all Federal Party candidates went to the Nallur Kandaswamy temple for a special pooja. SJV also went and waited bare-bodied with respectfully folded hands. Former Kayts MP V.Navaratnam wanted Chelvanayakam to be photographed as accepting the “Kalanchi” a sign of Hindu religious adherence.",
        "This was a bid to diffuse anti-Christian tensions in the electorate and portray Chelvanayakam as a man who observed Hindu rituals despite being a Christian. Chelvanayakam refused saying that while he respected the Hindu religion he would not stoop to pretensions of worship. He would lose the election rather than winning through such a ruse he said. So lose he did.",
        "Yet the same man whose religion proved a handicap in 1952 went on to win six more elections in KKS continuously in 1956,1960 Mar, 1960 Jul, 1965, 1970 and 1975. This he did without compromising on his religious principles or resorting to religious charades.",
        "There were also efforts made to undermine the Federal Party credibility by political rivals who raised the Christian bogey questioning Chelva’s right to lead the Hindu majority Tamils.Chelvanayakam’s able “Hindu” lieutenants countered this type of propaganda effectively.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s spate of victories in Kankesanthurai (83% Hindu 16% Christian) were all the more remarkable from another point of view too. Chelvanayakam was not the conventional MP attending to the day to day needs of the people. He concentrated more on the overall problems of the Tamil people.",
        "Later deteriorating health kept him away from the electorate too. Despite all this the KKS Voters continued to elect him. Former Senator and Ex-Chairman of the Jaffna DDC S. Nadaraja was of yeoman service and more or less functioned as the unofficial MP for Kankesanthurai.",
        "The Federal Party continued to be the dominant political force among the Tamil’s notwithstanding Chelvanayakam’s religion. Subtle anti-Christian attempts however continued. One was the Tamil Congress demand for a Hindu University in Jaffna as opposed to the FP demand for a Tamil University in Trincomalee. This was a blatant move aimed at embarrassing the FP and Chelvanayakam on religious and regional lines. It was also a manouevre calculated to appeal to the Hindu Jaffna voter.",
        "Even as Tamil political rivals attempted to undermine or replace Chelvanayakam’s leadership certain Sinhala sections also sought to question his leadership credentials. They attempted to discredit him on the grounds that he a christian was not the proper representative for the Hindu majority Tamils. Yet Chelvanayakam was sure of his ground as he had been elected continuously without having to compromise on religion. These victories were also a tribute to the basically secularist attitudes of the Tamil people and the essence of tolerance prevalent in the Hindu religion.",
        "A case in point was the reply proffered to a letter written by the Ven. Hewanpola Ratnasara Thero in the “Ceylon Daily News” of 3 oct 1970. Chelvanayakam wrote” You referred to my religion as Christian and therefore I had little in common with Tamils who were mainly Hindus by religion. It stands to the credit of the Hindu people that they have not forced me or other Christians to change our faith before we lead them”. This was an obvious reference to the “Donoughmore Buddhists” phenomenon when some Sinhala Christians became Buddhists to improve their electoral chances after universal franchise was introduced under the Donoughmore Constitution. There was some communication on these lines between Chelvanayakam and the Government in the 1960-65 period too.",
        "It should be noted that the anti-colonialist nationalist revivals of the Sinhala and Tamil people had certain similarities and differences. A moot point was that of religion. Revivalism initiated by Anagarika Dharmapala and Arumuga Navalar was religion oriented and revolved around the Buddhist and Hindu religions respectively.",
        "The continuation of this revivalist process in the post Independence period however saw a major difference.Sinhala political discourse continued in the same vein with Sinhala Buddhist nationalism becoming the dominant ideology among the Sinhala people.",
        "In the case of the Tamil people who saw themselves as the victims of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism the reaction was different. Their response was basically linguistic and not religious. When Tamil nationalism arose in defiance of Sinhala nationalism it became more secular. It was not a Tamil Hindu nationalism.",
        "There are many reasons for this but two significant causes contributing to this were SJV Chelvanayakam and Rev Fr Thaninayakam the Tamil Catholic Scholar. Father Thaninayakam spearheaded a Tamil cultural revival by promoting a world wide interest in Tamil studies. This made the Tamil proud of his or her glorious heritage.",
        "Chelvanayakam led the Tamil political movement against the imposition of Sinhala. His presence as the great helmsman of the Tamil ship saw him charter a course of secular Tamil nationalism centered around language. The assertion of linguistic nationalism was successful enough not only to embrace Tamil Hindus and Christians but also include the Muslims too at a particular period under the concept of “Tamil Speaking People ”.",
        "The man who advocated Tamil rights with a missionary zeal was not one who engaged himself in politics willingly.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s ambition was to mount the Supreme Court Bench.Circumstances beyond his control or in his view God’s plan for him led him to politics. Later an opportunity arose where becoming a Supreme Court Judge was very possible. This was when DS Senanayake sensing that Chelvanayakam was going to be uncompromising in his political position sought to remove an obstacle through the offer of Judicial office.Overtures were made through two emissaries. Chelvanayakam sensing the motive behind the offer turned it down thereby  turning his back on his lifelong ambition in order to pursue a lofty but cumbersome political ideal.",
        "During the tumultuous Donoughmore era Chelvanayakam while observing political developments keenly kept aloof of Tamil politics. He first showed an open interest in politics in the forties when he accosted GG Ponnambalam at the Colombo Law Library and voluntarily affixed his signature to a memorandum being sent to Whitehall on the Tamil question.",
        "Thereafter Chelvanayakam began involving himself more closely with Tamil Political affairs and became active in the Tamil Congress. Sivasubramaniam the father of former Kopay MP Kathiravetpillai was instrumental in persuading him to enter active politics. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation led by GG Ponnambalam that made representations to the Soulbury Commission. Soon Chelvanayakam began immersing himself in Tamil Congress activities and by 1946 was considered the”vice-captain” of Ponnambalam.",
        "Jane Russell describes this development in her book “Communal politics under the DonoughmoreConstitution” in the following manner-",
        "“The emergence of SJV Chelvanayakam, a christian and a Colombo Lawyer as Ponnambalam’s second-in-command was significant. Unlike Ponnambalam who was concerned largely in satisfying his personal ambitions for power,  Chelvanayakam was seriously concerned with the political effect of the Sinhala Buddhist cultural resurgence on the future of the Ceylon Tamils.”",
        "“ Chelvanayakam was a thoughtful man; as a politician he displayed the integrity which Ponnambalam lacked. His Tamil communalism was not the froth of an opportunist but a deeply-felt and considered judgement backed by an appreciation of Tamil culture which amounted to blind loyalty. Chelvanayakam’s attachment to the Ceylon Tamil culture came much closer to a true Tamil nationalism and his gloomy views and oracular attitude proclaimed him the heir to the aged Ponnambalam Arunachalam who had turned in his bitterness from the ideal of a united Lanka to the concept of a Tamilnad or Pan-Tamilian state in his solstitial years.”",
        "“ Although SJV.Chelvanayakam did not present a differentiated policy to that of GG.Ponnambalam in 1947, his political approach augered a radical change in the tone and demeanour of Ceylon Tamil politics in the post-Independence period”",
        "In 1947 the Tamil Congress contested elections to Parliament and won seven sea seats, Chelvanayakam himself contested and won Kankesanthurai polling 12,126. He defeated both Nagalingam of the LSSP and Natesapillai of the UNP. Soon political differences began erupting between Ponnambalam and Chelvanayakam over the future course of the Tamil Congress. Prof. A.J. Wilson, son-in-law of Chelvanayakam in his book “SJV Chelvanayakam and the crisis of Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism, 1947-1977” describes the situation thus",
        "“Ponnambalam interpreted the mandate of responsive cooperation” with progressive-minded Sinhalese parties, received at the general election of 1947 as an authorisation to the ACTC by the Tamil electorate to secure portfolios in the cabinet, where a Tamil presence would enable Tamil problems to be aired and benefits obtained for the Tamil areas.”",
        "“ Chelvanayakam for his part preferred to use Tamil cooperation as a lever to obtain an acceptable resolution of Tamil concerns relating to citizenship rights for the Indian Tamil plantation workers, parity of status for the Sinhala and Tamil languages, an acceptable national flag for the new State and the cessation of state-aided colonisation of the Tamil speaking areas with Sinhala colonists. He wanted these pre-conditions satisfied. Most important he wanted a constitutional assembly convened to determine the Island’s future constitutional structure. Ponnambalam did not obtain these guarantees”",
        "Even after Ponnambalam became a minister and voted with the government on Citizenship issues .  Chelvanayakam did not break away immediately. Instead he dilly-dallied as to whether he should remain within Tamil Congress ranks and fight it out with Ponnambalam or whether he should form a new political party. Finally he broke away with Kopay MP Vanniyasingham and Senator EMV Naganathan. The Federal Party or Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi in Tamil was launched in 1949 December.",
        "Chelvanayakam and his party ushered in an Ideological shift in Tamil politics. He formulated Tamil nationalism on linguistic lines and channelled that into a clearly demarcated territory thereby providing a territorial dimension. The Northern and Eastern Provinces were the traditional homelands of the Tamil speaking people. These provinces would form an autonomous Tamil State (Thamil Arasu). This state would come into a federal arrangement with the residual Sinhala state and remain within a Ceylonese union.",
        "The party sought equality of status for both the Sinhala and Tamil languages. This demand was not for the Ceylon Tamils alone but for all Tamil speaking people such as the Muslims and The UP-Country Tamils. The party was also against the demographic structure of the Tamil Traditional homeland being altered through Sinhala colonisation.",
        "In 1952 the fledgling party did not fare well and won only two seats Vanniasingham in Kopay and Rajavarothayam in Trincomalee. Another FP backed independent won in Batticaloa and crossed over to the UNP the following day. Chelvanayakam as mentioned before lost too.",
        "SJV’s views on the dangers facing the Tamil people did not find a responsive chord in the community then. But as Sinhala Buddhist Nationalists began gaining ground in the South a corresponding Tamil nationalism too gathered momentum in the Tamil areas. Soon the increasingly alarmed Tamil People began to look upon Chelvanayakam as a prophet who predicted this impending doom and felt that he was the saviour who could lead them at this critical juncture. The meek and mild Chelvanayakam was becoming the single-most popular mass figure in Tamil Politics.",
        "1956 was the watershed! SWRD Bandaranaike swept the polls in the South on the Sinhala Only platform while the Federal Party won six seats in the North and Four in the East.",
        "The Federal Party under Chelvanayakam began a new culture of political protest. This was  “Non-violent agitation” modelled on Gandhian Philosophy. The first major demonstration was the Satyagraha launched on Galle Face Green when Parliament was debating the Official Language Act. Thugs and hoodlums backed by politicians in power set upon the Satyagrahis and mercilessly assaulted them while the police watched with their “hands Tied”.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s son himself was assaulted in front of the Father while SJV sat unflinching. The Tamil poet Kasi Anandan immortalised that episode through a poignant poem",
        "Other non-violent activities such as protest marches, black flag demonstrations, hartals, boycotts.letter writing campaigns, non compliance of administrative regulations.tar brush campaigns Satyagrahas etc were continuously launched along with political mass meetings, processions, rallies and Conventions.All these activities made the Tamil People a highly politicised community.",
        "Chelvanayakam was now described as “Thanthai Chelva” and “Eelathu Gandhi” by his followers. “Thanthai” came from the Dravidian movement where the father of the Dravidian movement EV Ramaswamy Naicker was called “Thanthai” Periyar. “EElathu Gandhi or the Gandhi of Eelam was from the Indian Congress culture. Chelvanayakam’s opponents ridiculed him as the”Kaatsattai Gandhi” (Trousered Gandhi). Most Party followers referred to him as “Periyavar”. Chelvanayakam had now acquired cult status and was almost a “Venerated” figure.",
        "Among the agitations conducted by the Federal party the most notable ones were the anti-Sri tar brush campaign and the mass Satyagraha of 1961. Chelvanayakam himself was jailed in Batticaloa in 1958 over the tar brush campaign .In 1961 the Northern and Eastern Provinces were administratively paralysed when Tamil Satyagrahis campaigned opposite Govt Secretariats. The Campaign reached its climax when a separate postal service was set up and a Stamp issued. Finally the Army was called in, Curfew imposed and Tamil leaders including Chelvanayakam detained and placed under house arrest. Chelvanayakam along with FP leaders had been detained in 1958 too.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s strategy when dealing with the Governments in power had been that of agitation cum negotiation. In fairness to the Federal Party it had despite it’s rhetoric and non-violent campaigns been more than willing to talk to the governments in power and arrive at a political settlement.",
        "In order to achieve political accommodation Chelvanayakam and the FP compromised to a great extent on their original positions. For instance they were amenable to regional councils and district councils instead of a formal federal set-up. They were ready to settle for special provisions regarding the use of the Tamil Language instead of rigid Official Language Status.",
        "Yet, sadly agreements entered into with two Prime Ministers were honoured in the breach in the face of mounting Sinhala extremist pressure. The Bandaranaike- Chelvanayakam pact of 1957 as well as the Senanayake-Chelvanayakam pact of 1965 if implemented may have resolved the Tamil problem long before it assumed such violent proportions. Likewise if Tamil grievances had been redressed when articulated in non-violent form through leaders such as Chelvanayakam armed violence need not have risen among Tamil Youths.",
        "In spite of Chelvanayakam’s apparent failure to resolve the Tamil problem through negotiations the Tamil People did not consider it his fault. The Tamil People perceived it as the fault of Sinhala leaders who had betrayed Chelvanayakam and by extension therefore the Tamils. Thus Chelvanayakam and the Federal Party could continue to win the bulk of Tamil Parliamentary seats. 10 in 1956,15 in 1960 Mar, 16 in 1960 July, 14 in 1965,13 in 1970.",
        "The FP always justified the contesting of Parliamentary seats on the grounds that Parliament was the supreme forum to articulate Tamil grievances. It also stated that Tamil Unity was essential to prevent divide and rule tactics by the enemy. More importantly it stated that Tamil MP’s by forming a bloc would hold the balance of power in a keenly contested Parliament. It could therefore bargain from a position of strength.",
        "These tactics succeeded to some extent in the 1960 March and 1965 elections where the Parliamentary clout of the FP became a crucial factor in the making and unmaking of Governments. The FP however was politically impotent when governments in power had strong majorities. The Federal Party itself reached the zenith of it’s Agitation cum Negotiation strategy in 1961 and in 1965-1968.",
        "In 1961 the Satyagraha which paralysed the North-East had demonstrated clearly the depth of feeling in the Tamil community over their legitimate grievances and the wide-spread support for the Federal Party. Yet the response was not political accommodation but the use of force to crush a democratic non-violent movement.",
        "If 1961 was the high watermark of the FP’s agitation strategy the negotiation strategy reached it’s peak in 1965. In 1965 the FP became a constituent partner of the National Government under Dudley Senanayake. An FP nominee Senator M.Tiruchelvam became the Minister of Local Government in the cabinet. The expectation was that some form of de-centralisation would be implemented through the District Councils.That attempt too failed.",
        "In that sense the FP had exhausted it’s strategical options by 1970 and when in that election the Sinhala electorate polarised heavily in favour of the UF government the possibility of bargaining within parliament too was removed. SJV expressed his frustration when he said in a statement that only “God could save the Tamils now”.",
        "Measures like Standardisation.the new constitution etc only aggravated the sense of alienation felt by the Tamils. The Political path pursued by Chelvanayakam no longer seemed relevant or worth emulating. Chelvanayakam’s health too began deteriorating. (suffered from Parkinson’s disease) He still remained the Supreme leader but Tamil political thought was moving rapidly in a different direction. The new “Manthras” were Thamil Eelam the separate state and Ayutha porattam or armed struggle. A helpless SJV too seemed caught up in the rising tide.",
        "At a protest march led by SJV the police banned it from proceeding further. Chelvanayakam directed his followers to sit down on the road itself and commence Satyagraha. Many obeyed him but a lot of youth refused and wanted to march on and confront the Police. Amirthalingam had a very hard time persuading the youths to sit calmly and finally they obliged for some time. Soon many youths broke out from the Satyagraha and began staging an unauthorised procession in many streets of Jaffna. They were ready to confront the Police but the police “ignored” them. That incident was symptomatic of the growing Youth rebellion and the increasing irrelevance of the old guard.",
        "Chelvanayakam’s greatest electoral achievement occurred in the twilight of his life. He resigned his KKS constituency in 1972 Oct and challenged the Govt to an election on the question of the Tamil People accepting or rejecting the new constitution. After considerable delay the by-election was finally held on 3rd Feb 1975. Chelvanayakam obtained an unprecedented 25,927 defeating V Ponnambalam of the Communist party by a majority of 16,470.",
        "In 1971 a loose alliance of Tamil political parties was formed. It was called the Tamil United Front. In 1976 the TUF renamed itself as the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) Chelvanayakam, Ponnambalam and Thondaman were elected as a triumvirate of leaders. The demand for a separate Tamil State was formally adopted. A new phase had begun in Tamil Politics.",
        "Chelvanayakam too espoused the demand for Tamil Eelam. He said that establishing Tamil Eelam was a difficult proposition but the Tamils had no choice if they wished to survive as a nation. He also went on record that only the Tamil youths could through their courage and sacrifice achieve Eelam.",
        "The proponents of Thamil Eelam and the armed struggle considered  these statements as the last will and testament of Chelvanayakam. They interpreted  it as proof that the Tamil Gandhi too was for armed struggle and that Tamil Eelam was his uncompromising position. Some  years ago LTTE spokespersons flabbergasted the public of Jaffna when they told a press conference that they were only following the footsteps of Chelvanayakam by conducting an armed struggle for Eelam. They quoted Chelvanayakam in support of their argument.",
        "The question of Chelvanayakam’s position on Thamil Eelam and the armed struggle is debatable and subject to the vagaries of various interpretations. What he would have done in the present context too remains hypothetical so many  years later. Persons close to him feel that he may have used the Eelam demand as a bargaining ploy to achieve Federalism and that he would never ever have extended support to an armed struggle. No one however has a definite monopoly of the truth in this case and the issue would remain a topic of unresolved academic interest.",
        "SJV Chelvanayakam died on April 26th  1977. He had a bad fall some weeks before his death and remained in a coma until his demise. His funeral was an exhibition of a genuine outpouring of collective grief never before seen in Jaffna. The greatest tribute to his memory was however the landslide victory of the TULF three months later in July. The name of Chelvanayakam and his political legacy was evoked to a very great extent in the election campaign.",
        "All shades of political opinion mourned his loss and the views expressed by Jayewardene and Athulathmudali are but a few indicators. These views  contrast considerably with earlier views expressed by Sinhala political leaders which were quite  uncharitable.",
        "“He is a lean and hungry looking man whom I cannot trust” said  DS Senanayake of Chelvanayakam. SWRD Bandaranaike’s comment on Chelvanayakam  was “He is surely one of the most dangerous types of human beings in the world, quite in his own way an idealist sincere, in his own way an idealist,  but having no idea whatsoever of reality and the practical side of things. Very dangerous people, such people”.",
        "This then was the sad state of affairs that prevailed then. The man who espoused non-violence and displayed the positive attribute of willingness to settle for something far short of his original demands was portrayed as untrustworthy and dangerous. No meaningful attempt was made to settle the problem peacefully with Chelvanayakam then.",
        "Today the memory of Chelvanayakam has practically faded. The Younger generation thinks that the struggle began with Prabhakaran and does not even know that this man  Chelvanayakam led a non-violent struggle for Tamil rights for nearly three decades.",
        "They do not know that this was a leader who was revered as an incorruptible, sincere man who would not let the Tamils down.",
        "They do not realise that if Chelvanayakam had not led the struggle in his own manner there would not have been a Tamil nationalist base for a future armed struggle",
        "The days of Veluppillai Chelvanayakam and his weapons of non-violence are gone and all that remains are  memories of the days of Veluppillai Prabakaran and his arsenal of deadly weapons."

      "original_title": "Ronnie de Mel’s George Keyt Paintings",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "I first met Ronnie de Mel (1925-2024) less than six months before his passing. At the time, he was 98 years old and confined to a wheelchair, yet his memory and sharp intellect were as formidable as ever. The purpose of our initial meeting was to interview him for information about another former politician with whom he had worked somewhat closely in the legislature. De Mel hailed from a different era—three or perhaps four generations before mine. Despite the age gap, his critical thinking and incisive responses often made more sense than those of many of his successors. In his most recent book Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha commented de Mel was “…intellectually head and shoulders above all subsequent Finance Ministers”. It is no exaggeration to say that de Mel was one of the architects of Sri Lanka’s Open Economy, introduced in 1977. As Minister of Finance, he successfully balanced 11 consecutive budgets and was a trusted confidante of President J.R. Jayewardene.",
        "The interview was arranged by his loyal personal secretary, Mr. Wilfred, who had served him for nearly 50 years. Upon entering Ronnie de Mel’s home on Charles Drive in Colombo 3, one of the first things that caught my attention was the impressive collection of paintings by the renowned Sri Lankan artist George Keyt. These works, displayed throughout the hall, immediately commanded focus. During the course of our one-hour interview, I found myself repeatedly drawn to these captivating pieces. It was evident that most of them were from an earlier period of Keyt’s career, characterized by a style less commonly seen in his later works.",
        "De Mel, perceptive as ever, noticed my frequent glances toward the paintings. When we paused for a break and refreshments were served, he remarked, “You seem to like those paintings.” It was a natural observation; anyone with an appreciation for art would surely admire Keyt’s distinctive style. I responded by commenting on the apparent age of the works, noting their earlier period. De Mel, with a slight smile, acknowledged my observation: “Ah, you noticed that. Seems you know a thing or two.”",
        "In truth, my knowledge of art history was limited, especially in relation to Keyt’s work. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to inquire further. I asked de Mel for permission to examine the paintings more closely, to which he graciously agreed. This moment, though brief, allowed me a more intimate engagement with the artwork, further deepening my appreciation for the collection that filled his home. The exchange served as a reminder not only of de Mel’s refined taste but also of the broader cultural connections that shaped his life and perspective.",
        "As I examined the paintings, I noticed the dates inscribed by George Keyt—ranging from the early 1920s to the 1940s. These works represented the earlier phase of his career, marked by a distinctive style less commonly seen in his later works. The pieces were primarily landscapes, with some depicting intimate human moments—one portraying a group of four men playing musical instruments, another capturing a woman playing a drum while two others danced. In contrast, a few later works reflected the style for which Keyt is most famous, with curvaceous women and vibrant village scenes.",
        "De Mel’s hall was graced with a dozen such pieces, and with a certain pride, he remarked that he might be the largest private collector of Keyt’s works. While I knew of other collectors who perhaps owned more, I chose to remain silent, respecting his claim. Yet, it was one particular painting, an oil on canvas, that truly held my attention: a scene from a rural village, where a man sat serenely on a swing, embraced by a woman with a darker complexion. The intimacy of the moment, captured in the brushstrokes, was striking, almost transporting me into the world it depicted. Keyt completed this painting in 1936.",
        "Ronnie de Mel in his Geekiyanakanda Estate in March 1978 (Times of Ceylon Collection)",
        "This painting, more than the others, seemed to pulse with life, evoking a deep emotional response. I was grateful when de Mel, noticing my fascination, allowed me to photograph it. The image lingered in my mind long after I left his home, a testament not only to Keyt’s remarkable talent but also to the quiet, timeless connection between art, memory, and the spaces they inhabit. Later on, when leafing through the book George Keyt: A Centennial Anthology (2001), I noticed some of de Mels paintings including the one that caught my attention. The painting was labelled as “Jhula”. Intrigued, I turned to my dear friend Malaka Talwatte, Chairman of the George Keyt Foundation, seeking insight into this enchanting image. He shared his thoughts on Jhula, offering a perspective that only deepened my admiration for the work:",
        "“In Hindu mythology, the Jhula (swing) is a symbol of love, spirituality, and social connection. The painting very clearly depicts one of the lovers on the swing whilst the other is embracing and holding the arms of the swing. This is an interesting period for Keyt as he had separated from his wife and was soul searching. He found it difficult to paint and had hence finished three volumes of poetry which were published by the Gamini press. The first volume was published in 1936.",
        "He was inspired by Hinduism and Hindu mythology at the time, and he did a number of similar paintings at the time of which the most notable being ‘Sringara Rasa’ which was in the collection of Mrs. Harold Peiris (Keyt’s sister), later donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Permanent Collection. Stylistically, he had eased himself to the approach of the modern artists of the west but with eastern themes and subjects close to his heart.”",
        "“You may wonder how I came to possess these,” Ronnie de Mel remarked. He then shared a glimpse into his past, recounting his days as a student at S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia, and later as an undergraduate at the University of Ceylon in the early 1940s. It was during this time that he first encountered George Keyt, a promising artist on the rise. De Mel confessed that, with careful frugality, he had managed to save a considerable sum, which he used to acquire a few of Keyt’s paintings during those formative years, when the prices were far more modest than they are today. One only needs to peruse auction catalogues featuring Keyt’s works to realize how dramatically their value has escalated. In the current market, it is safe to say that possessing a painting by Keyt now requires a fortune.",
        "I recently learnt that when de Mel, then finance minister, was entertaining a couple of his friends for dinner at his home told a woman batch-mate at the university admiring one of his Keyt’s: “Remember, all of you laughed at me when I bought this then for fifty rupees. How much do you think it’s worth now?” The lady, clueless about prices of artwork, but knowing the figure would be high, guessed wildly: “A couple of million?” De Mel responded “three times that will e more likely.”",
        "I inquired of de Mel whether his artistic interests extended beyond George Keyt, to which he replied that, while no other artist resonated with him as Keyt did, he was a steadfast supporter of Sri Lankan contemporary art as a whole. He confessed, however, that he found little affinity for artworks that invoked religious themes, though he did hold a deep appreciation for Tamil artists in Sri Lanka.",
        "Later, Wilfred, de Mel’s loyal secretary, shared an interesting detail: George Keyt, ever the professional, would always ensure that an official was present at his exhibitions, and de Mel, in turn, would carve out time from his demanding schedule to attend whenever possible. Another prominent figure who closely associated with and supported Keyt during that period was President J. R. Jayewardene.",
        "Much of their connection is documented at the J. R. Jayewardene Centre. A mutual friend who bridged the worlds of de Mel, Keyt, and JR was the esteemed historian, Prof. K. M. de Silva. Wilfred later spoke of how Prof. de Silva would often visit de Mel, engaging in spirited conversations about their shared love for paintings and the vivid memories of Keyt. I, too, have had the privilege of admiring a few of Keyt’s works displayed at Prof. de Silva’s residence on Devani Rājasinghe Mawatha in Kandy. A few of these paintings are featured in George Keyt: The Absence of a Desired Image, a recent work by Dr. SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda. Prof. de Silva has often recounted his fond recollections of Keyt, who, like him, spent his final years in Kandy until his passing in 1993.",
        "It was widely known that during the years de Mel worked tirelessly on the national budget and delivered his comprehensive Budget Speech in Parliament, he sought refuge and solace at his estate in Geekiyanakanda. Wilfred recounted how the peaceful surroundings of the estate offered de Mel much-needed respite. Another source of solace for de Mel during these times of intense pressure was his collection of Keyt’s colored paintings. Wilfred shared that de Mel had a deep affection for these works; he found a quiet rejuvenation in gazing upon them, often feeling refreshed after a few moments spent in their presence.",
        "It was by quite chance recently, that I discovered an image in the Times of Ceylon collection in the Sri Lanka National Archives, when going through their collection of photographs, of de Mel coming down the stairs of his residence clasping a copy of Sir Dingle Foot’s British Political Crisis. Behind de Mel is the painting of the two villagers I mentioned earlier. This photograph was taken by Oliver Seneviratne and published in the  Sunday Times on November 8, 1981, four days before de Mel presented his fifth budget in Parliament.",
        "As I reflect on de Mel’s paintings, I am drawn to the enduring power of art to evoke deep emotions and preserve memories. George Keyt’s paintings, especially the intimate rural scenes, seem to transcend time, capturing fleeting moments of life with a vibrancy that resonates across generations. The way Keyt’s work immersed me in its world is a reminder of the timeless connection between art and memory, a bond that continues to touch the soul long after the artist’s hand has left the canvas. Art, in its quiet majesty, holds the past close, ever alive.",

        "The effort of the March 12 Movement, a civil society collective, to bring presidential candidates onto one platform and share their visions and hopes with the general population was successful in its second round. All six of the presidential candidates who had been scheduled for the debate participated as expected and shared their visions and aspirations for the future. Their message went through the electronic and mass media to the general public. Although titled as a “presidential debate” the structure of the programme was different from that practiced in the United States, where the presidential candidates engage in verbal sparring with one another.  The Sri Lankan version was to pose the same question to each of the presidential candidates and have them answer within a set time limit.",
        "The intention of the March 12 Movement was to provide an opportunity for the presidential candidates to present their views on issues of interest to the public rather than engage in debate on them. At the conclusion of the presentations, the audience was to be invited to submit their questions in written form where they would be screened for content by a committee and passed on the candidates for their responses.  However, despite all these safeguards to ensure the presidential candidates a safe environment, the first round of the debates held the previous day saw only one of the six invited candidates appear for the debate.  The others, including the three main presidential candidates, did not join.  They either declined in advance or failed to show up at the time of the event much to the chagrin of the audience, some of whom had come from Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Puttalam.",
        "It appears that the tight nature of the three-cornered race between the presidential candidates is leading to a stressful situation in which none of them is willing to take a risk and expose themselves to an audience that is not in their sphere of influence. This was a negative phenomenon, as an open clash of different positions, strategies and actions on common issues is beneficial to educating the general public as well as generating new ideas about facing the future in the spirit of a shared future.  Unfortunately, the tight nature of the presidential election time around, with three main candidates in the field, and not two as usual has also led to a significant amount of negative campaigning where the focus is on criticizing one or both of the nearest rival candidates.",
        "In recent weeks, public opinion polls have shown President Ranil Wickremesinghe to be the biggest gainer (in proportional terms) in comparison to his two main rivals, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.  However, these same surveys also show that the president continues to lag behind his rivals.  This may explain the measures being resorted to by the presidential candidates such as engaging in negative campaigning by critiquing the qualities of their rivals.  At the same time, they have also been engaging in positive campaigning regarding the need to address the country’s most pressing problems.  There has been a convergence among them on the need to abide by the basic framework of the IMF agreement which has opened the doors to the country’s economic ties with the larger world.",
        "There is also convergence on the part of the three main presidential candidates on the need to deal with the country’s ethnic conflict.  They have all promised to deal with the issue in a way that will unite the people on the principles of equality and justice.  They have all been making strenuous efforts to win the votes of the ethnic and religious minorities. This is very positive, as the ethnic conflict has been a part of divisive politics since the dawn of independence.  However, due to the tight nature of the competition, there is also negative campaigning vis-à-vis each other.  During a recent visit to Jaffna, the NPP leader called on the Tamil voters not to thwart his victory or be seen as not being on the winning side along with voters in the south of the country who will vote for him.  This has been portrayed as an implied threat to the Tamil people whereby he has called on them to vote for him and be a part of the electoral victory that the NPP/JVP is seeking rather than voting against him and losing the opportunity to be a part of this victory.",
        "The approach by ITAK spokesperson M A Sumanthiran has been positive in this regard.  He has disagreed with the negative interpretation given to the NPP leader’s speech in Jaffna and said he never thought the NPP leader made that statement with a view to expressing any racist feelings and that he has taken great care in eradicating racism in this country. The ITAK spokesperson said he would work with the NPP to eradicate corruption and misrule in the country. Indeed, these are the two most important aspects of the Aragalaya protest movement that led to the premature change of government two years ago but which have yet to be dealt with. These laudable statements by Mr Sumanthiran are now the subject of misinterpretation that he has changed sides.",
        "The key role in the recent decision of the ITAK to endorse the presidential bid of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa was also made by Mr Sumanthiran.   He led the ITAK to make a choice between the presidential candidates and to select the candidate whose manifesto and past commitment was believed to be the best for the Tamil people at this juncture.  At the same time, he has shown that he will not be hostile to other political parties and their leaders, even those his party has not endorsed, and be open to cooperate with them in the best interests of the Tamil people.  The spirit of leadership that the country needs is not to hold grudges, to look for the best in others and to hold them to the highest standards.",
        "The Sri Lankan people continue to suffer in the aftermath of the economic collapse that took place over two and a half years ago.  The need of the hour is national unity to face the local and international challenges that a world which is itself increasingly in conflict will find difficult to focus on.  This suggests that the Sri Lankan polity cannot afford to be torn apart by polarization and misinterpretation which can generate more of the same.  The vicious cycle needs to be addressed.  The country and its people need to be united to face the challenges.  In a situation where the people’s vote will be split more than three ways, the possibilities of polarization are increased.",
        "The hope of the March 12 Movement in organizing the presidential debates has been to provide a platform where the presidential candidates can indicate the areas of their agreement on fundamental issues so that government policies would be consistent regardless of changes of government. President Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment at a media conference when he said “We need a political system that supports basic fundamentals, even if we differ on details. This is what our country needs and what all desire.”  The challenge to each of the presidential candidates is to commit themselves to support the winner of the presidential election, even if it is not themselves that wins. The way they conduct themselves and address the people and their opponents during the election campaign will determine the prospects for reconciliation in the future.",

      "original_title": "Can Ranil  Wickremesinghe  Regain the Support of Tamil and Muslim Voters at the 2024 Presidential Elections?",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Sri Lanka’s last official census was taken in 2012. According to that census, Sri Lanka’s majority ethnic community the Sinhalese comprises 74.9 % of the island nation’s population.  Numerically, the second largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Tamils who are 11.1% of the population. The third largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Muslims or Moors who comprise 9.3% of the population. The fourth largest ethnic group is the Tamils of  Indian origin known as “Malaiyagath Thamizhar” (Hill Country Tamils) who are 4.1%.",
        "The three numerical minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils together are 25.5% of the population. These three ethnic groups form the majority in some Sri Lankan districts. In other districts they are a substantive segment of the population. Since the people of all districts vote together in the Presidential elections, the entire island is transformed into a “single” constituency with a 74.9% Sinhala majority and 25.5 % non – Sinhala minorities.",
        "Therefore the three ethnic minorities  have played a significant role in presidential elections from the time the executive presidency was introduced. The voting pattern of the Tamil and Muslim communities in previous presidential elections was discussed in detail by this column last week.",
        "The focus of this series of articles has been on incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s strategy and plans about contesting the 2024 presidential polls. As such this week’s article would try and assess the plus and minus points of President Wickremesinghe vis a vis the Tamil and Muslim voters.",
        "Ranil Wickremesinghe as mentioned earlier has generally been popular among the Tamil and Muslim voters of Sri Lanka. The bulk of Tamil and Muslim voters supported him in 1999 and 2005 when he directly contested the presidential elections. The three minority ethnicities also strongly supported the presidential candidates backed by Ranil in 2010, 2015 and 2019  namely Sarath Fonseka, Maithripala Sirisena and Sajith Premadasa.",
        "The United National Party (UNP) in general and Ranil Wickremesinghe in particular received a tremendous jolt in the 2020 Parliamentary elections. The party polled only 249,435 (2.15%) votes in the country. For the first time in its history, the grand-old party failed to get an MP elected. The UNP polled only 30,875 (2.61%) in Colombo which was considered its stronghold for decades.",
        "This electoral debacle was mainly due to the bulk of the UNP’s sitting MPs breaking away and forming the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) under Sajith Premadasa’s leadership. While the Rajapaksa-led Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) swept the polls in 2020, the SJB came next. Premadasa became the leader of the Opposition.",
        "Though Ranil had much political support among Tamils and Muslims for many decades, the 2020  poll reversed the situation. It was the UNP breakaway, the SJB led by Sajith Premadasa, which got the bulk of Tamil and Muslim votes. In fact, one-thirds  of the MPs elected from the SJB in 2020 are Muslims and Tamils.",
        "The question that arises at this juncture is whether Ranil Wickremesinghe can win back the Tamil and Muslim votes  lost by the UNP to the SJB  in 2020? Can Ranil  regain the support of Tamil and Muslim parties and voters to help him win the 2024 Presidential poll? Let us briefly gauge the situation in terms of each of the three main ethnic groups in this regard.",
        "It is clear that Ranil Wickremesinghe will contest the presidential elections as a non -party independent candidate. He will be supported by an alliance of political parties, groups of MPs, individual MPs and  organizations.  Ranil however will not be a candidate of this alliance. Instead the alliance will only back the non -affiliated Wickremesinghe. Hence the extent of support Wickremesinghe could get from the three minority groups can only be estimated by the number of Tamil and Muslim MPs and parties backing him.",
        "What must be understood is that the votes obtained by these  parties and individual MPs may not be reflective of the current situation. We do not know whether these parties and MPs are still retaining the same vote banks of 2020 or whether they have either got eroded or been enhanced. Another key point is vote transferability. Even if these parties and MPs do have a vote bank, would it be possible to transfer those votes fully  in support of  Ranil Wickremesinghe? Will these voters support Ranil in the presidential elections?",
        "Let us take the Tamils of Indian origin known as the Hill Country Tamils (Malaiyagath Thamizhar) first. The largest Trade union and chief political party representing the Up Country Tamils is the Ceylon Workers Congress. The CWC is now a constituent of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Government. It has two MPs elected from Nuwara Eliya in Parliament. CWC Gen. Secy Jeevan Thondaman is a Cabinet minister. CWC President Senthil Thondaman is the Eastern province Governor. The CWC will back Ranil strongly at the elections.",
        "Ranil’s bond with the CWC was further cemented on May Day this year. The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC)  held its rally in Kotagala. President Ranil Wickremesinghe who was the chief guest at the huge CWC rally brought joyful news  to the workers  gathered in Kotagala.  He announced  to a wildly cheering audience that the daily wage of plantation workers had been raised from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,700.",
        "The 700 rupee increase amounted to a 70% pay rise. The president displayed a copy of the Gazette proclamation to the people. He had taken the trouble to get it gazetted on April 30. The positive effect of the 700 rupee wage increase will transcend beyond the estate line rooms  and  impact on the whole community. It will demonstrate that the President and Government is concerned about them.",
        "Though the CWC is the foremost Party of the Hill Country Tamils, it does not have a monopoly of Parliamentary seats.  In fact it is the Tamil People’s Alliance (TPA) that has the largest number of Up Country Tamil MPs in Parliament. The TPA  is an alliance of three parties namely the Democratic  People’s Front (DPA) led by Mano Ganesan, the National Union of Workers (NUW)  led by Palani Digambaram and the Up Country Peoples Front (UCPF) led by V. Radhakrishnan.",
        "The TPA  contested the 2020 Parliamentary polls  on the SJB ticket and got six seats. Three in Nuwara Eliya, one each in Badulla, Kandy and Colombo. One MP Aravinthakumar elected from Badulla crossed over to the SLPP Government in 2020 and was expelled from his party. He is now a state minister in the  Ranil-led  Government. The TPA has so far remained with Sajith Premadaa’s SJB in the opposition. There are however rumblings of discontent and grumblings of dissatisfaction within the SJB bosom.",
        "There has been much speculation that the TPA will split with the SJB and support Wickremesinghe’s candidacy at the right time. The TPA refusal to sign a memorandum of understanding with Sajith’s SJB  is a possible pointer. It indicated that the TPA did not want to tie-up with the SJB prematurely. The alliance wanted to weigh its options and decide at the opportune moment. In short the TPA   wants freedom to transfer allegiance to Ranil whenever it wants to do so. Until then it will be in but not of the SJB. Some also opine that the TPA may get divided on this issue with some MPs staying with Sajith and others throwing in their lot with Ranil.",
        "The current UNP-SJB split is basically an ego clash between Ranil and Sajith. There are no major policy differences. In fact they are the same ideologically. The SJB itself is old UNP wine in a new SJB bottle. There is much yearning among the rank and file of both parties to re-unite and confront the SLPP and JVP together. This grass-root feeling is reflected among the Tamil and Muslim party allies of the SJB too.",
        "It is perhaps due to this factor that TPA leader Mano Ganesan  along with Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem are trying hard to re-unite the SJB and UNP. If there is rapprochement between Ranil and Sajith, minority party leaders like Mano and Rauff would be spared the unenviable task of choosing between the two. This however seems unlikely and so the TPA will have to decide whether it supports Ranil or not in the near future. This may cause a split in the party.",
        "Apart from the CWC and the TPA, Ranil has received a shot in the arm in the form of Badulla MP Vadivel Suresh the influential Secretary of the Lanka Jathika Estate Workers Union (LJEWU). Suresh who opted to desert Ranil and join Sajith got estranged from the latter. He is now back with the UNP and was seen on the UNP  stage on May Day. Thus Ranil appears to be on a strong footing as far as “Malaiagath Thamizhar” voters are concerned with the CWC, LJEWU and elements of TPA support.",
        "Let us move on to the  Sri Lankan Muslims. The chief Muslim Party the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC)  remains with the SJB in the Opposition though some of its MPs  supported the Gotabaya Government earlier. The SLMC too has not signed a MOU with the SJB as requested by Sajith recently. SLMC leader Hakeem like TPA leader Ganesan has been trying hard to reconcile Sajith and Ranil and re-unify the UNP.",
        "Observers of the Muslim political scene feel that the SLMC would support Ranil at the presidential election. Though Rauff Hakeem  has been playing his cards close to his chest, a number of MPs in the SLMC are for Ranil. There is every likelihood of them revolting if Rauff remains with Sajith. Besides the newly appointed Wayamba Governor Nazeer Ahamed is capable of triggering a pro-Ranil revolt within his former party the SLMC if necessary.",
        "The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Rishad  Bathiudeen will also support Wickremesinghe when elections are announced. Rishad refused to sign a MOU with the SJB. He is already displeased with Premadasa over several issues including the alignment with “Viyathmaga”MPs.. ACMC dissidents like  MPs Rahman and Musharraf are also supportive of Ranil.",
        "The National Congress led by AHM Athaullah is firmly backing Ranil. Athaullah is the uncrowned king of Akkaraipattu. Former Batticaloa MP Hizbullah who has considerable support in Kattankudi will back Ranil.  Though Hizbullah is  now back in the SLMC and is an office-bearer in the party, the “Sultan”of Kattankudi is a maverick who will defy the party and support Wickremesinghe if the SLMC opposes Ranil.",
        "Thus the three Muslim parties (SLMC, ACMC and NC) dissident Muslim MPs   and influential politicians  like Hizbullah will support Ranil. Furthermore Muslim MPs  elected directly on the SJB ticket like Hashim, Mujibur Rahman and Imran  Maharoof may also support Ranil if and when they split from the SJB. It appears therefore that Wickremesinghe is likely to get  much Muslim support in the presidential election.",
        "Finally we come to  the Sri Lankan Tamils. What Ranil is sure of at present is the support of two Tamil parties in addition to his own UNP. The EPDP led by Douglas Devananda and the TMVP  led by Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan are part of the Wickremesinghe Government.  Devananda is a Cabinet minister and Pillayan a state minister. The EPDP has two elected MPs. The TMVP’s Pillayan got the highest number of preference  votes in Batticaloa. Devananda also has a limited yet stable vote bank in the North. The UNP is not very strong in the North or east nowadays, but people like ex-Jaffna MP Vijayakala  Maheswaran can deliver a chunk of votes for Ranil. The former state minister has remained faithful to the UNP and Ranil.",
        "Batticaloa MP Viyalendran who split from the TNA and joined the SLPP in 2018 is now a state minister. He too is likely to back Ranil. Then there is Angajan Ramanathan who was the only MP to get elected on the SLFP ticket in 2020. Angajan got the highest number of preference votes in Jaffna in 2020. The politically astute Angajan  is likely to hitch his wagon to the Ranil star at the right time.",
        "Former Supreme Court Judge and Jaffna district MP  C.V. Wigneswaran voted  for Ranil at the presidential  poll held in Parliament on 20 July 2022. Therefore he is likely to support Ranil but the consistently inconsistent Wigneswaran may change his mind again. In any case it does not matter because CVW  has negligible support among the people now.",
        "The All  Ceylon Tamil Congress has two MPs. But the party led by Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam will not participate in a presidential election and has called upon Tamils to boycott the poll.",
        "The premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which got ten seats in the 2020 elections. The TNA is fractured now with two of its three constituents the TELO and PLOTE forming a new alliance called the Democratic Tamil National Alliance (DTNA) with three other parties including the EPRLF. The chief TNA constituent Ilankai Thamil  Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) now stands alone. Of the original ten TNA Parliamentarians, the ITAK has six MPs while the TELO and PLOTE have three and one respectively.",
        "It is too early and too dicey to attempt to gauge what the ex-TNA constituent parties will do in the 2024 presidential poll  because none of them have declared their intentions  so far. These parties may decide only after elections are officially announced.  They will engage with the chief candidates and arrive at a decision based on those discussions.",
        "However, in the 2022 Presidential election the TNA declared its support for Dullas Alahapperuma and not Ranil Wickremesinghe. Yet there were unconfirmed reports that only four of the  TNA’s ten MPs had voted for Dullas. The rest had either voted for Ranil or spoiled their votes. Ranil himself hinted jovially  that some in the TNA voted for him. Some reports say the DTPA may support Ranil though the front is yet to declare its position openly.",
        "Meanwhile the ITAK itself is now fragmented into two camps. One is supportive of S. Shritharan and the other supports MA Sumanthiran. Furthermore the ITAK is now enmeshed in a legal tangle. The hopelessly divided party seems unable or unwilling to present a common position in courts.",
        "Against this backdrop it is virtually impossible to predict what the ITAK may do in the presidential poll. However, there are straws in the wind which indicate that  some individuals in both the ITAK camps are likely to support Ranil.",
        "There is optimism in the UNP that the Sri Lankan Tamils will be very supportive of Ranil. These sections opine that Ranil could appeal to the Tamil people directly regardless of Tamil party support and harvest Tamil votes. Given the positive image enjoyed by Ranil among North-eastern Tamils, this  move could prove successful.",
        "However there are two current developments  that could work negatively against Ranil. The first is the move by certain quarters to field a common Tamil presidential candidate. If this happens, the “common Tamil candidate” may siphon off potential Tamil votes supportive of Wickremesinghe.",
        "The second is the conduct of the Police in handling the peaceful  commemoration  of the Humanitarian  tragedy that engulfed Tamils in May 2009. The 15th anniversary  is being memorialised by the distribution of porridge  called “Mullivaaikkaal Kanji “ in coconut shells to people in a token gesture of remembrance. This is to denote the fact that hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians trapped in Mullaitheevu district could only have kanji as food in those dark days.",
        "The Police in the Eastern province have cracked down hard on persons who allegedly distributed Mullivaaikkal  Kanji. Male Policemen  have reportedly dragged  wailing women out of their homes   and arrested them. Three women including an undergrad and a man have been remanded for allegedly distributing porridge to people.This happened in Mutur. Court orders were  obtained in some places like Kalmunai banning the distribution of porridge as a health hazard.  In  Eravur,Policemen prevented people from partaking of the Porridge and allegedly kicked down the pot with the Kanji.  The Police action is  saddened and angered  the Tamil people.",
        "This high handed, unreasonable conduct is reflecting badly on President Wickremesinghe.  He is being blamed for the actions of the Police. So much so that ITAK spokesperson M.A. Sumanthiran  addressing a media conference reportedly said “Ranil Wickremesinghe need not come here canvassing for votes if this continues”.",

        "Kumarika, hair care brand from Hemas Consumer Brands, has launched an initiative that brings personalised hair care experiences directly to customers via its mobile salon truck, ‘Hair Play Studio.’",
        "The ‘Hair Play’ campaign is designed to allow customers to experience and enjoy the benefits of Kumarika’s latest range of shampoo and conditioner, which has been meticulously crafted to cater to all Sri Lankan hair types.",
        "This exclusive experience provides customers with an opportunity to enjoy a variety of personalised and fun sessions, which are aimed at addressing their hair care needs. The Kumarika Hair Play Studio experience begins with a personalised hair analysis, where a professional analyses a customer’s hair, and recommends the most suitable Kumarika product for their specific hair problem. Thereafter, the customer will experience a hair wash using the recommended shampoo and conditioner, offering them a first-hand feel of the product. To add a special touch to the Hair Play Studio, customers also had a chance to purchase a personalised 80ml or 180ml bottle of Kumarika shampoo with their name on it. This initiative was greatly appreciated by consumers. Following the hair wash, a highly skilled stylist will create a personalised hair style based on the customer’s preferences, ensuring that the style reflects their individuality.",
        "Kumarika’s newest additions to its vast range of products, Damage Repair, Hydrating, Strong Hair, and Healthy & Black shampoo and conditioner variants, are manufactured to address damaged hair, dry or frizzy hair, weak and breaking hair, and dull hair which allows customers to try and play with different styles. This means they no longer have to worry about damage caused from the heat from hair styling tools, various hair treatments, pollution or even the weather. These new products add to the brand’s growing portfolio of hair oils, shampoos, conditioners and hair serum.",
        "With plans to soon bring this thrilling experience to towns across Sri Lanka, including the Western, Southern, and Central provinces, Kumarika kicked off its campaign during the Colombo Shopping Festival at the BMICH. The goal of this initiative is to offer customers in various regions a unique, customised experience that emphasises individuality and self-expression.",
        "Hemas Consumer Brands Category Manager Hair Care Hirushi Fernando said, “We are excited to offer our customers a unique experience that allows them to embrace their individuality with their hair. Our goal through the ‘Hair Play’ concept, is to give people the confidence to express themselves, knowing they have the support of Kumarika’s natural, carefully crafted products, allowing them to customise their hair styles as they see fit, without any fear. These aren’t just ordinary hair care items; they’re solutions specifically designed for Sri Lankan hair, ensuring protection and nourishment no matter the type. This initiative was a great success and saw a fantastic gathering of consumers and influencers attend the event.”"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "I got interested in the subject I write about today since Aravinda, who is a frequent Man Friday to me tackling all sorts of help jobs including cell phone manipulation, went on a hike from Hatton to Ohiya along jungle trails. He climbs Adams Peak out of season and along the Kuruwita climb which is the most arduous.",
        "Hike is defined as distance walking for exercise or pleasure. Eco trails can, I presume, be termed nature walks. Googling these were two definitions I got: “Eco trails are long distance, way marked hiking and cycling routes” which “aim to build a sustainable ecological community of travellers with local tourism and cultural bodies and local commerce.” All types of walks are gaining popularity as people become more health conscious, but eco trails particularly are popularized in tourist countries noted for their ecological variety like Sri Lanka",
        "A marathon is a long distance foot race with a distance of 42.195 km or 25 miles 385 yd usually run as a road race, but can be covered on trail routes. More than 800 marathons are run annually in big cities all over the world being real athletic events or pleasure ones where entire families take part. A New York family ‘ran’ a marathon at Thanksgiving – end November last year with the two sons completing the full 26.2 miles in record time, the father slower running, and the mother walking most of the distance chatting to a taking-part companion.",
        "The marathon was one of the original Olympic events in Athens. When the Games were restarted in Athens in 1896, Michel Breal got the marathon reintroduced.",
        "I often get messages from my second son in Atlanta announcing his having run a marathon along Peachtree Road and along a runway in the airport – largest worldwide. The Peachtree Run is held on July 4 and is said to be the most popular 10 km in the world with about 60,000 taking part. He does 5 km runs in winter and a half Marathon of 21 km which he says calls for much training.",
        "Local ancient trails Pada Yatra as its name implies is a walk on foot with a purpose. As defined in Wikipedia it is “a journey undertaken by politicians or prominent citizens to interact more closely with different sections of society mostly to educate about issues” A much more ancient pada yatra is the religious journey undertaken on foot of which the Jaffna to Kataragama is the oldest, its beginning lost in antiquity. The 45 day walk starts in Mullaitivu and en route pilgrims are fed and housed in villages. Often pilgrims from South India join the Sri Lankan travellers.",
        "The pilgrimage to the summit of Sri Pada, aka Samanalakande and Adam’s Peak is of significance to Buddhists, Hindu and Muslims too, with a connection to the Old Testament of the Holy Bible and the great flood caused to cleanse the world, because one tale is that Noah from his ark found land in the vicinity of this peak. The climb from the base of the rock is 2,243 m or 7,394 ft.",
        "However whichever way one travels, particularly the Hatton way which I have traversed four times, means much longer walking. Four routes lead to the summit; the most used being the Hatton route due to it being free of jungle, with steps most of the way and lit during the season from December to May. It has gained greater popularity and now it seems to be an item on many a tourist’s island agenda. Didn’t Princess Anne and her husband, accompanied by the British High Commissioner, successfully complete the climb? We do hope crowds gave them space, which was seen to be woefully lacking when they visited the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.",
        "My first hike was as a 15-year old student. Our class teacher, revered Ms Olga Wijewardena bravely conducted us 24 teenagers up Hantane hill in Kandy. It was then a tea estate with a factory and lines for workers. Our teacher decided to take us on an unbeaten track, climbing up with no footpath, fighting the over six-foot high manna grass. No major accidents except a couple of half tumbles, a foot swallowed by a rabbit burrow and a slide down or two. Exhilarating to reach the top and gaze around. The misadventure was suffered later when evening showers were taken back in the hostel. The skin, incised by manna leaves, stung severely as cold water drenched it.",
        "I vividly remember climbing Sri Pada as a very young teacher with the senior Girl Guides of Hillwood College. Brave of the Guide Leader/teacher to organize this hike. We climbed all the way in pelting rain but all was forgotten as we gazed at the dancing sun as it rose above a range of hills opposite to Sri Pada.",
        "This 56-year old is a hiker to the core. When I write that I remember Jayanthy Kuru-Utumpala who summited Mt Everest on May 21, 2016. She told me that all family holidays in",
        "the island when she was young, were to places where hills or mountains were available for her to conquer. On trips overseas as a career woman, she would save her stipend and climb a mountain in the country she was in or in an adjoining one. So strong was her love of climbing; rewarded with the honour of being the first Sri Lankan, if not the first South Asian woman, to achieve this feat.",
        "As I mentioned earlier, Aravinda does his annual pilgrimage up Sri Pada off season, most often alone, notwithstanding inclement weather, wild animals – elephant and leopard – roaming all around. God Saman must surely be protecting him.",
        "His latest was running one of the Independence Day marathons; the one he joined being organized by a scooter club. He was accompanied by a 66 year old co-hiker/runner. The run of 23km started off from the Kelaniya Temple with around 85 participants. They followed the Low Level Road to Hanwella. There refreshments were served and many mounted scooters and went further to Horana. A stop, river bath in the Mavak Oya, and then the return to Colombo on scooters.",
        "The more interesting was his hike with his co-walker on the 10th section of the Pekoe Trail which covers 300 km. They went by train to Hatton and stepped out to the bitter cold at 1.30 am. Dozed on hard benches since the waiting rooms were locked, till 5.00; had a snack from the station canteen and took the 6 am bus to Dayagama. Halfway through the bus stalled, so without waiting for its repair, the two walked to where their trail started, adding a couple of kms to their hike. Once on the trail surrounded by luscious leaved thin forest and superbly fresh air, they started their walk via Horton Plains. The only wild life they saw was a huge stag but varied butterflies and birds were constant companions. They reached Ohiya with dusk falling. They had walked about 30 km.",
        "The interesting feature is that many homes in the Ohiya area, and very probably elsewhere along the trail, are into Home Stay business even to foreign tourists offering B&B with dinner added on. Aravinda and friend stayed with an old couple who welcomed them warmly, gave them a rice and curry dinner with dried fish, dhal and only one vegetable. It was both tasty and substantial. The room they got was comfortable with an attached toilet. Aravinda said he had only to hit the pillow to sleep soundly till shafts of sunlight woke him. Then to a good breakfast and to the station to entrain to Colombo. The cost of this stay for both was Rs 4,000/-",
        "The point I wish to make in this article is that Sri Lankans are health conscious, appreciate nature very much, indulge in getting away and manage relatively cheaply. Seems to be that eco-trailing is popular among locals and advertised and catered for by the Tourist Board and other travel agencies. Sri Lanka is so very rich in its natural heritage too. No wonder it is heavily praised as a tourist destination catering to a wide variety of tastes, interests and pleasures.",

      "original_title": "NPP Dilemma: Rhetoric vs. Reality, Present Ideology vs.Past Ideology",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Colombo, Jan. 22 (Daily Mirror)- With vital elections looming on the horizon , rhetorical remarks from across the political divide have become the norm for each passing day.",
        "It is common for political leaders of all hues to fine-tune their speeches with rhetorical language as a vote catching ,crowd pulling exercise. In the process, what is done is ostensible concealment of truth from the general public in the couch of rhetorical language . Voters who get carried away by political rhetoric are at the receiving end finally.",
        "In recent times , the National People’s Power , the political amalgamation led by the Marxist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) , has launched into swift action ahead of the presidential election to be announced likely in September, this year .",
        "Its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake regularly hits the headlines because of catchy remarks made in addressing public meetings. In one instance , he spoke about imprisonment of those accused of corruption and frauds. He spoke in definite terms in this regard. Rooting out corruption is the dire need of the hour . Nobody can be opposed to any measure being initiated to address the issue in whatsoever manner . However, imprisonment of anyone over corruption and fraud is only the result of a judicial process after investigation . One wonders how Mr. Dissanayake, along with his NPP colleagues, speaks with precision about imprisonment even before any judicial process commences. After judicial process , it can even be a different form of punishment other than a jail term . As such , Mr. Dissanayake’s remarks amount to mere rhetoric aimed at mesmerizing prospective voters who yearn for an era sans corruption .",
        "In another instance , he is reported to have said that he will dissolve the security details assigned to him if he is elected to the top office at the elections. Normally , the security assigned to the Head of State depends on threat assessment by the security authorities at the time concerned . One wonders again how such pronouncements are made in advance even before the presidential election is conducted .",
        "The NPP was in the centre of controversy in recent times over remarks by one of its female leaders Samanmali Gunasinghe who stressed the need for legal protection of sex workers under a government led by her party. In an interview with online media , she said the number of women resorting to sex trade is on the rise under the current economic circumstances. Therefore, she emphasized the need to legalize it for better protection of women who indulge in sex trade. Once the news story appeared , all hell broke loose because legalization of prostitution is something against the social,cultural ethos of the country.",
        "Another female leader from the N.P.P Dr. Harini Amarasuriya was at pain to contain the damage saying that prostitution would not be legalized , but the current laws related to sex trade would be amended only to give legal protection to women involved . It is just playing a game of words to cover up possible electoral damage arising from Ms. Gunasinghe’s remarks .",
        "The JVP- led NPP is now confronted with ideological contrasts among its own ranks .Previously,the party remained a cohesive force with a clearly defined lines on its policy approaches . All its members used to stick to one line in making public utterances.In the expansion of the party for the formation of NPP accommodating outsiders , the JVP appeared to have lost its cohesiveness as its members utter contrasting viewpoints.People are at a loss to find what its actual position is .",
        "Its politburo member K. D. Lalkantha freely draws examples from its 1988/1989 violent period . Once his remarks triggered public concerns whether the party would resort to violent tactics to capture power . After that , the party asked its members not make any remark that leaves scope for different interpretations .",
        "The party is also in a struggle to reconcile its past and present ideologies . No doubt it has transformed a lot . The party which was critical of any deal with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) now seeks engagement with it . The party which was opposed to private universities tooth and nail now accepts the importance of it. The JVP once shredded the 13th Amendment to the Constitution . It has a different approach to it now , though . Some of its members find it difficult to detach from from the traditional leftist thinking whereas others clamor for neoliberal approaches .",
        "All in all , it is in a political dilemma trying to garb its present ideology with the sheen of the former one ."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "(Excerpted from Memories that linger – my journey in the world of disability by Padmani Mendis)",
        "Prof. Chandra Gunawardene was the Dean of the Faculty of Education at the Open University of Sri Lanka, OUSL, at the turn of the century. I was recommended to her by her friend Prof. Swarna Wijetunge who had been a Professor of Education at the University of Colombo. Prof. Wijetunge was a member of the National Education Commission. She had always been sensitive to the poor quality of education available to disabled children. Prof. Gunawardene was keen to take action to uplift this through improvement in teacher education.",
        "So she obtained the approval of the OUSL in 2004 to set up within the Open University a Department of Special Needs Education. She asked for my help to do this and had me recruited to the Faculty as a Senior Consultant. I set about getting the preliminary arrangements done. Meanwhile she also recruited to the Department of Special Needs Education two senior lecturers. She arranged for these two to proceed directly to the University of Lahore and return with their Doctoral Degrees to start academic activity in the Department. One of the first such activities was a Bachelor of Education Honours in Special Needs.",
        "The University of Colombo, since 2009 was running an “Ability Centre for Students with Disabilities”. It was helping students in a small way. Ashoka Weerawardena was running this centre.",
        "Aloka Weerasekera had in 2012 obtained a degree from the Faculty. Aloka, as a student, had helped the Faculty and his disabled colleagues within it, to deal with the some of the problems they faced. And even after he graduated he continued to help Ashoka at the Ability Centre.",
        "A new dean, Prof. Athula Ranasinghe, was appointed to the Faculty of Arts in 2011. He proposed that it was time that the Faculty demonstrated greater academic leadership in disability. Aloka and I were brought in to join the staff of the Department of Sociology on a planning committee to find a strategy for putting into practice this academic support for disability.",
        "The end result of the planning committee’s deliberations was the setting up in 2014 of the Centre for Disability Research, Education and Practice popularly called CEDREP.",
        "In the same year the US Embassy came in with a grant to finance improvements to the Ability Centre for the benefit of students. This Centre was upgraded and had its role and name changed to the “Support Centre for Students with Disabilities”. I was a frequent visitor to assist Ashoka with what I could. CEDREP called on me for advice in the early years when they needed it.",
        "A significant outcome of CBR at the grass roots was the setting up of disability self-help groups. Fridsro helped in this in the government-supported CBR areas throughout the island. Unfortunately, government workers later made these into District Disability Organisations over which they could and did have influence. As was to be expected, the autonomy within the small self-groups was gone. Many disabled people who had been empowered through their self-help group were disillusioned and turned away.",
        "Others, such as Nishar Sharif, persist even today, raising the issue of their rights and their inclusion within the district and province. Navajeevana encouraged the formation of self-help groups in the CBR areas they supported. These also developed into Divisional Disability Organisations. I have met some on my visits to the south. Although they are sustained with some financial support from Christoffel Blinden Mission, CBM, they maintain their autonomy and empowerment and participate in area development planning and activities.",
        "In Sri Lanka there has not even until now been any kind of Disability Movement. In Colombo personable individuals set up organisations to publicise the needs of particular disability groups. Occasionally they would obtain sponsorship to implement interventions. Some have been led by disabled people themselves and others have not. There was debate about these at the time. Within the world of disability, it was felt that the organisation had to be managed by disabled people themselves to be recognised as a Disabled Peoples’ Organization (DPO). If it was managed by a non-disabled person or people, then it was thought of as an NGO.",
        "So the Sri Lanka Council for the Blind (SLCB) which was actually single-handedly run by S. L. Hettiarachchi, himself with visual impairment and totally unable to see, was considered to be an NGO. Its president, although only in a nominal role, was not disabled. Soon after I started working with the School of Social Work, I met Mr. Hettiarachchi. I used to meet him often thereafter for a chat in his office. We developed a close life-long friendship until he passed away in 2015.",
        "With Mr. Hettiarachchi in the driving seat, the SLCB carried out many activities for young people – particularly, courses which imparted skills and knowledge scarce elsewhere such as in Mobility and Orientation and Information Technology. On a Saturday morning I would often drop in for a chat with the young people there.",
        "What impressed me most was the Library the SLCB developed with an extensive collection of both written and audio publications made easily accessible to the many who availed of its resources. Mr. Hettiarachchi then extended the library to the thirteen Special Schools for the Blind located throughout the island and were registered with the Ministry of Education. He later sought and obtained support for this from Sight Savers International, SSI.",
        "Three years later SSI requested me to evaluate the impact of their support to benefit children. One of the most interesting findings regarding project’s impact was the children’s increased love of reading. Many had become avid readers. Many had taken to reading a new book every two to three days. Many had shown improvement in language development, reading and writing skills, grammar, vocabulary and verbalisation. It strengthened my belief that it was the SLCB, as organisations were at the time, that had the greatest impact on disabled people.",
        "Another disabled person with whom I shared both a working relationship and friendship was Premadasa Dissanayake. Premadasa hailed from a village in Badulla in the Uva province. He came to Colombo as a wheel-chair user to seek employment. This he got at the Gangarama Temple in Colombo, first learning the skill of watch repair and then as a teacher of other young people both those who had disabilities and others who had not, to acquire the same skill.",
        "He never forgot his roots and later, when he was able to implement field programmes, they were located around the village he came from. He impressed others with his honesty, diligence and hard work.",
        "Premadasa was the core of the, Sri Lanka Foundation for Rehabilitation of the Disabled (SLFRD), which he established with support. Within this, he had soon set up a workshop to produce a range of appliances required by people with mobility impairments – wheelchairs, tricycles, crutches and so on. This workshop called Rehab Lanka bid for and obtained tenders for these and was a regular supplier to both the Ministry in Colombo and to Departments of Social Services in the provinces.",
        "With funding from the Swedish Organisation of the Handicapped International Aid Foundation, he moved into community-based work. I enjoyed very much walking the villages in Badulla with his staff.",
        "Such was the recognition Premadasa had that one of Sri Lanka’s leading garment manufacturers negotiated an agreement between Rehab Lanka and Marks and Spencer popularly known as M & S, the well-known chain of retail stores in the UK. Premadasa trained workers of the garment factory to produce the items they made for M & S. Training was done according to the technical and quality requirements as stated in the agreement between M & S and Rehab Lanka.",
        "Working with Premadasa at Rehab Lanka was Cyril Siriwardene. Cyril had started using a wheelchair since he had met with a road traffic accident while serving in the Air Force. With his assertive but pleasant personality and skilled use of the English Language Cyril was soon recognised as a leader and disability spokesperson both by disabled people and by others.",
        "It was Cyril, Premadasa and Mr. Hettiarachchi that established a dialogue with the Ministry of Social Welfare. This was the time that Viji Jegarasasingham (Mrs. J) had come to the Ministry as an Additional Secretary. She was open to it.",
        "The Ministry of Social Welfare and disability groups soon had a regular conversation. An outcome of this was that in 1996 the first Disability Law was passed. This law was concerned mostly with the setting up of a National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD), and with strengthening the provision of disability services within government. The NCPD was of course to be chaired by the Minister of Social Welfare.",
        "As a positive step, the law ensured a majority participation of disabled people and their representatives in the NCPD, recognising their right to decision making in matters that affected them.",
        "Recognising this in law but not, unfortunately, in practice. It is still the Ministry of Social Welfare that makes all decisions in the field of disability. Even in the making of a new law, a seemingly continuous process started in the year 2004 and is as yet incomplete.",
        "I was not aware of the preparation or enactment of that law in 1996. Maybe I was too concerned with international work at that time. I served however on two consecutive National Councils, the first of which was set up as soon as the law came into effect in 1996.",
        "My experience was that we did not really do anything to bring about changes in the lives of disabled persons and their families. Much of the monthly meetings dealt with acceding to requests by disability organisations and disabled people for financial assistance for a range of purposes from renovating buildings to organising sports events to staging concerts by disabled people.",
        "Disability work was still very much based on charity. The disability representation at large on the National Council however appeared to be satisfied sitting with the minister every month and telling him of their woes. A vivid recollection I have of the first council is the minister, while sitting at the head of the long table, tucking in with satisfaction into a bowl of fruit salad. I must also say that to me he seemed not even to listen to what was being said.",
        "At the beginning of this decade there was some visible activity in the Ministry of Social Welfare as it concerned the world of disability. A newly introduced government regulation called on each ministry to develop national policies in areas it was mandated for. For our ministry this included disability.",
        "Consulting the few disabled people she interacted with at the time, Mrs. J had appointed a renowned disabled person to make a draft national policy on disability or NPD. Repeated reviews and revisions did not result in a satisfactory document. This was apparently leading to some frustration all round. Mr. Hettiarachchi talked with me about it, and I wrote for him a brief note on how a national policy may be developed. It had to be a participatory and consultative process.",
        "Together with his colleagues he took this to Mrs. J and they suggested she talk with me about it. The result was that she asked me whether I could do this. I said of course, but with two conditions. One was that the ministry appoints a committee to make the task participatory, and the second – you will not believe it – that she appoints me as Chairperson and let me suggest to her the 12 members that should constitute the committee. I knew my Sri Lanka and she obviously knew me.",
        "The Minister was informed, letters of appointment were received and very soon the committee and our support staff were seated round a table at the ministry – not the one I referred to earlier and there was no bowl of fruit salad.",
        "Our committee represented people with the most prevalent disabilities through their organisations, and those sectors that had to be most involved with disability and disabled people. We started our work with reports from them, each related to the area of their particular concern. Followed by discussion about the situations presented and very preliminary policy suggestions.",
        "In spite of the wide representation on our committee one large gap was evident. No one really knew the situation of disabled people and their families in our country. It was my task to inform Mrs. J that we had to determine this through a socio-economic survey before we could go ahead with policy formulation. All she said was, “How much will you need?” It was then my responsibility to bring to her quotations from three sources known for their experience in conducting such tasks.",
        "She selected one and said she would find the money required. This was Rs. 750,000 for an island-wide sample survey. Nielson Sri Lanka completed the report in three months. Together with the Rs. 400 each member was paid by the ministry as transport cost per meeting, the preparation of the NPD cost just over Rs. 900,000. Our committee took joy comparing this to what the formulation of a draft National Employment Policy cost at about the same time – Rs. 13 million. That cost was met by a foreign donor and the policy was never approved.",
        "During the many meetings that followed, we interviewed dozens of persons, both as individuals and as groups. We had Mrs. J arrange for us interviews with secretaries of ministries, heads of institutions and UN and other agencies, DPOs and NGOs with whom we consulted on the content and formulation of the policy. In this way we benefited from the experience and insight of a countless number of people.",
        "When we presented the National Policy on Disability that our committee had produced to the minister who was at the time Ravindra Samaraweera, he asked me why we had taken four months when he had asked for it in three. But he was pleased and soon had it approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.",
        "Those were Sri Lanka’s good times. Now, but precious memories.",
        "The success achieved by her Ministry with the publication of the National Policy appeared to motivate Mrs. J to take this process further. So within a few months she had appointed another committee to ensure legal validity for the Policy. This time I was appointed Chairperson with no notice of it. The four other members of the committee she selected were all attorneys. One also had experienced disability, having had visual impairment from a very young age. He had his wife read out to him at home the documents that the committee had written or typed as text.",
        "Our mandate was to see if the existing law of 1996 was adequate to implement the NPD. And if it was not, to draft a new Disability Rights Bill. Well, that was how the task was stated, but there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that a new Bill was essential. A new law was needed to ensure the fulfilment of the rights of disabled people.",
        "Preparation for drafting this document required a completely different process. As members, we gathered together all published laws in Sri Lanka that had any relevance to our task. We also gathered together laws that had been made by other countries. Then we sat down to reference these and gather precedent information that we could be used for our draft bill. We also sought the help of many individuals to advise us on sections of the draft.",
        "On completing a preliminary draft, we had the ministry translate it for us into Sinhala and Tamil and opened these to the general public. This preliminary draft was amended with the feedback received. The first draft Disability Rights Bill (2006) was submitted to cabinet for approval as was required at the time. Mrs. J was happy to inform us when approval was received within two weeks.",
        "She asked us whether the committee would continue to help the ministry get the draft through the Legal Draftsman’s Department, which we did with negotiations and simple compromise. We continued to help the Ministry with the next step, which was the Attorney General’s Department.",
        "Here we met our first obstacle. This was the attorney rather junior at the time, tasked with the review and approval of it. We never got it past her. I see that attorney is still in the department, now almost at the top. Well, sad to say, that Bill is still a draft.",
        "Later in 2009, the whole process changed completely. This was when a new Minister came in. He had the bill redrafted by an individual whose name is unknown to this date. Politicisation was in force. Numerous revisions and drafts have been made since then, and the process is even now ongoing. My personal view is that the ministry fears that with a new bill, it will lose control over disabled people and over disability. So, no new Disability Rights Law.",

        "Linda Speldewinde: This year is a big one for us not just because of the 15-year milestone, but because we’re stepping into a new era. Partnering with DIMO for MBFWSL adds a fresh dynamic, blending fashion with innovation and luxury. It’s exciting to see how these global brands align with our vision, bringing something new to the table and elevating the way we showcase Sri Lankan talent.

It’s not just a fashion show; it’s a statement about where Sri Lanka is heading as a creative hub for South Asia.",

        "Rajeev: Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week provides a platform for Sri Lankan designers to collaborate with a globally recognised brand, enhancing their international visibility. This association allows local fashion talent to gain recognition on the global stage.",
        "Both DIMO and our long-standing partner Mercedes-Benz for 85+ years share a deep commitment to sustainability, innovation, and quality—values that are also integral to the fashion industry. With this glamorous platform, we’re showcasing the country’s ability to innovate and create high-quality, sustainable lifestyles, reinforcing Sri Lanka’s image as a hub for creativity and innovation in the global marketplace.",
        "This event will open doors for strategic partnerships that can elevate local talent while reinforcing Sri Lanka’s status as a fashion destination for high-quality, luxury, and innovation.",

        "Linda: Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week is an unparalleled platform for Sri Lankan designers, providing young talent with the opportunity to interact with international markets and gain exposure to global standards. AOD graduate, Amesh Wijesekera is a perfect example, where his collection at MBFWSL won the award for IDEP, Mercedes-Benz International Designer Exchange. Entry into this program, along with the mentoring support for emerging talent from around the world by Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Global, led him to be the first Sri Lankan designer to showcase at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin, a pivotal moment in his career. MBFWSL continues to offer such opportunities, elevating the next generation of designers and showing the world that Sri Lanka is brimming with creativity and potential.",
        "Q: Rajeev, Mercedes-Benz is globally renowned for blending luxury with sustainability. DIMO also plays a crucial role at the national level in endorsing sustainability.  How do Mercedes-Benz and DIMO align with Sri Lanka’s goals for a greener future?",
        "Rajeev: Mercedes-Benz exemplifies how luxury and sustainability can coexist, proving that sophistication need not come at the environment’s expense. As an example, the Mercedes-Benz EQ range, with its sleek designs and advanced electric powertrains, represents a new era of automotive innovation, blending elegance with eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technologies. As the exclusive partner of Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka, DIMO plays a pivotal role in building a sustainable ecosystem, offering comprehensive solutions from electric vehicles to home charging and solar power installations.

Both the fashion and automotive sectors can drive sustainability forward, and this event highlights the synergy between global initiatives and local efforts.",
        "Q: Linda, Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka has evolved over the years, what new elements can we expect this year, and how do they contribute to the long-term vision of making Sri Lanka South Asia’s creative hub?",
        "Linda: Hosting this year’s event at Cinnamon Life, alongside the Sri Lanka Design Festival, aligns perfectly with our goal, positioning Sri Lanka as South Asia’s creative industries hub. By merging fashion, art, and music, we’re fostering a cultural dialogue that inspires and elevates the creative industries in the region, ultimately contributing to our vision of making Sri Lanka a creative epicentre in South Asia.",
        "This year, we are also excited to unveil several dynamic elements that will elevate the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week experience. A standout feature will be the Mercedes-Benz Lounge, which will serve as an exclusive networking space and showcase Mercedes-Benz Art, highlighting the remarkable works of the esteemed artist Anoma Wijewardene as the Mercedes-Benz Art spotlight artist 2024. Her powerful and thought-provoking pieces reflect our commitment to integrating art into the fashion narrative.  Furthermore, the event will maintain a strong connection to music, underscoring Mercedes-Benz’s standing connection to music and how it influences and enriches the fashion experience. This synergy between fashion and music is essential as we aim to create a vibrant event that resonates with creativity and innovation at Colombo’s new fashion address, the Cinnamon Life at City of Dreams Sri Lanka.",
        "Q: What do you hope Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2024 will leave behind for the future years, both for the Sri Lankan creative industries and the global fashion community?",
        "Rajeev: For over eight decades, DIMO has transformed Sri Lanka’s luxury automotive sector in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, setting new standards in innovation. We aim to showcase how luxury and innovation can integrate, establishing Sri Lanka as a beacon for cutting-edge design and craftsmanship. We hope the legacy of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2024 will be one of pioneering innovation and collaboration in Sri Lanka that will elevate the local creative industries and international fashion sphere.",
        "Moreover, our commitment to supporting local talent, through initiatives that merge fashion with art and music, will create a dynamic platform that inspires not only our local industries but also resonates globally. We envision this event as a catalyst for ongoing partnerships, elevating Sri Lanka’s profile in the global fashion community and driving economic growth through the creative sectors.",
        "Linda: MBFW 2024 is to be a powerful testament to the transformative potential of the creative industries as a pathway to make a contribution to Sri Lanka’s economic revival. This event should ignite passion and ambition in the next generation of designers, artists, and innovators, encouraging them to push the boundaries of creativity.",

By blending cutting-edge fashion with global trends and local craftsmanship, the event underscores the potential of Sri Lanka as a leader in the creative industries in South Asia with MBFWSL is as more than just a runway show but a movement that embodies resilience, creativity, and a forward-thinking spirit which will deliver something special for Sri Lanka."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "(Excerpted from Rendering Unto Caesar by Bradman Weerakoon, Secretary to the Prime Minister)",
        "Mr Bandaranaike was to address the UN General Assembly sessions in the first week of October and was to leave for New York on the September 28, the Monday after the weekend. As usual it was necessary to advice the governor-general as to who would act for the prime minister while he was away from the country. On Wednesday, the afternoon of September 24, I met Mr Bandaranaike with the customary pile of papers for signature and orders at his office on the second floor of Parliament.",
        "I inquired of him as to who would act as prime minister during his absence abroad. Without a moment’s hesitation, since he had obviously given it some thought, he said, “Mr Dahanayake, the Minister of Education.” I remember being a little surprised at this as Mr Dahanayake had not acted as prime minister on earlier occasions. The usual practice and tradition was for the Leader of the House to be so appointed. However C P de Silva was ill and out of the country, being treated in London for acute nephritis and, as rumoured by some, for having drunk by mistake at a Cabinet meeting a poisoned chalice of milk. Moreover, Dahanayake was not one of the ministers of the SLFP, having come into the MEP as an MP of the Bhasha Peramuna, a party that had won only a single seat at the elections.",
        "The next afternoon, Thursday, with the letter to the governor general duly prepared in terms of Article 46 (iv) of the Constitution, I saw the prime minister again in his Parliament office. It was the last time I was to see him alive. It seems prophetic now and I recall the incident vividly. As he looked over the letter before putting his long and spidery signature to it, he glanced at the wording of Article 46. It was couched in the usual legal jargon “to act for the prime minister during his absence from the country or temporary incapacitation.” Always quick to seize on the nuances of phraseology his eyes caught the rhythm of “temporary incapacitation” and with a half-smile on his lean face rolled the words around his tongue. It is a memory, which has lived with me since.",
        "As soon as I had his signature on the letter I went to Queen’s House, on the way back to office, and handed the letter over to N W Atukorale who was Sir Oliver Goonetilleke’s official secretary. The next morning as Mr Bandaranaike lay mortally `incapacitated’ at Rosmead Place his home with four revolver bullets in his body, the governor-general had before him in writing, a nominated successor.",
        "That morning, September 25, 1959, had certainly been a black Friday. I was with the trusted Linus Jayewardene, the doyen of confidential stenographers dictating the programme of activities for the prime minister in New York to be printed in the customary Visit booklet. The prime minister’s personal aide at the Rosmead Place residence, D P Amerasinghe telephoned to say that someone had shot “Lokka”.” I still recall Jayewardene’s immediate quite inappropriate reaction, “My Gosh, what now happens to my leave,” as I pushed aside my papers and ran for the car.",
        "There was no time to get an official car or driver (there were only two assigned cars at the time – one for the prime minister and one for the secretary) and so I drove my Fiat 1100 straight to No 65 Rosmead Place. The severely wounded Mr Bandaranaike, with Mrs Bandaranaike who had seen it all happen, had been taken to the General Hospital close by. The three children had gone to school and were being informed.",
        "The front verandah was in a total shambles. What I saw was overturned tables and chairs, scattered papers, blood on the floor, broken glass, a crazy looking monk in dishevelled robes holding his abdomen and moaning on the floor of the hall inside, with a lone constable, a rifle at the ready over him and lots of sobbing people.",
        "There was work to be done so I left, first to the ‘Merchants Ward at the General Hospital where Bandaranaike had been taken. Sir Oliver was already there, and in charge, making sure that the next procedural steps would be initiated. The usual first step of a declaration of emergency was not necessary since the emergency regulations were already in force since the race riots of mid-1958 and the subsequent industrial strife of the first half of the year. Mr Bandaranaike had insisted on a message to the Nation and this was being readied as I arrived at the hospital. The last words Bandaranaike spoke, as he was being prepared for surgery will stand as an immortal testament to the life of a man of extraordinary compassion and nobility:",
        "“A foolish man dressed in the robe of a bhIkku fired some shots at me in my bungalow this morning. I appeal to all concerned to show compassion to this man and not to try to wreak vengeance on him.",
        "I appeal to the people of my country to be restrained and patient at this time. With the assistance of my doctors I shall make every endeavour to be able to continue such services, as I am able to render to my people.",
        "“I appeal to all to be calm, patient and to do nothing that might cause trouble to the people.",
        "To those closely connected to me, to Mrs Bandaranaike and my children, to the members of the government and all my friends and well-wishers, I make a particular appeal to be calm and to face the present situation with courage and fortitude.”",
        "I drove back to the office to prepare for the swearing in of the acting prime minister. Shortly before noon, as Mr Bandaranaike lay at deaths door, having undergone complicated abdominal surgery — a team of five doctors under the expert eye of the eminent surgeon P R Anthonis spent five hours in the operating theatre, the business of government went on. Mr Dahanayake was duly and constitutionally appointed acting prime minister before Sir Oliver Goonetilleke and in the presence of Atukorale, M P Perera, Dahanayake’s private secretary and myself.",

        "There are about 107 rehabilitation camps for Sri Lankan Tamils in the Tamil Nadu state. Most of them came into existence about 37 years ago. The rehabilitation camps at Kottapattu in Tiruchi district and Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district are among the biggest refugee camps in the State.",

Though the State government made attempts to repair the badly damaged houses, it is said that the condition of them has deteriorated due to age and other factors. Based on the field reports of the condition of the camps and the demands of the inmates, the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and the Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils has decided to build new houses at Kottapattu.",
        "A senior official told The Hindu the State government had sanctioned INR 300 million for building new houses to the Sri Lankan refugees living at Kottapattu camp. Most of the houses were in a poor condition. It had been proposed to build more than 500 houses. The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) would be entrusted with the task of building the houses.",
        "The houses would be constructed close to the existing camp at Kottapattu. The process of identifying a site was on. Once it was identified, the construction work would begin.",
        "The official added the inmates of the camp would not be disturbed until the completion of new houses, and they would continue to live in the existing houses. They would move to the new campus after the allocation of new houses."

        "As cyber threats escalate globally, the imperative to design, deploy, and utilize AI securely has never been more pressing. There’s an urgent call to adopt proactive measures, heighten threat awareness, and prioritize cybersecurity education to safeguard not only ourselves, but also our organizations and data. Recently, Microsoft unveiled its sixth edition of Cyber Signals, a quarterly cyberthreat intelligence brief, which draws from the latest Microsoft research, offering expert insights into the current threat landscape. This edition of the report underscores the importance of securing AI technologies to prevent misuse and highlights Microsoft’s efforts in protecting AI platforms from emerging threats posed by nation-state cyber actors.",
        "The report delves into the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools of interest for threat actors and emphasizes the growing utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in both offensive and defensive cyber operations. Microsoft introduces guiding principles aimed at mitigating these risks, particularly addressing threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats, Advanced Persistent Manipulators, and Cybercriminal Syndicates leveraging AI platforms and APIs. These principles include identification and action against malicious threat actors’ use of AI, notification to other AI service providers, collaboration with other stakeholders, and transparency.",

        "Multifactor authentication (MFA) is rigorously applied across Microsoft, prompting attackers to resort to social engineering tactics, particularly in areas offering high value, such as free trials or promotional pricing. To counter such attacks, AI models are developed to detect them promptly. Additionally, Microsoft employs AI to identify fake students, accounts, and organizations attempting to evade detection by altering data or concealing identities.",

      "original_title": "WHO Totalitarianism – The Ideology Of Lies",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The killer virus narrative has been tried for many decades. With AIDS, Mad cow, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, Ebola, Zika, Monkey Pox, Corona and now with Mpox. But it was only by 2019, with Covid that all the actors and collaborators, like building blocks, were in the right places and the integrity of every public institution and media station had been forsaken.",
        "The false narratives were boosted by the media. Sick bodies in crowded wards, throats slit to fix ventilators, military trucks transporting bodies to crematoriums. Like a still life limited to the boundaries of its frame, reality was compressed into newspaper headlines and television announcements. Truth, existing out of the picture frame was excluded. It did not say that those hanging on ventilators were the aged with multiple drug related co morbidities and suffering terminal cancers, emphysemas, pneumonias and other chronic pathologies. Nor did it convey the verity of the military trucks. Nor did it say that medical doctors had been given new Covid treatment guide lines that were contra indicated to viral infection treatment and drugs and remedies that were known to ameliorate viral pathologies had been delisted and forbidden.",
        "That was the fate of Ivermectin and Hydro chloroquine. The WHO orchestrated a narrative through a flawed scientific publication that indicated Hydro chloroquine’s lethality. The lethality was caused, not for the toxicity of the drug, but for the WHO’s chosen scientist administering a lethal dose of 3000 mg to his trial group. There were plenty of scientific papers, since decades, proving success by treatment of a regular doses of 50 or 60 milligrams for viral infections. But the WHO did not want an old drug, it wanted a new patented technology. From which, the greatest profits could be made. How much of our health care budget has been squandered for the purchase of Moderna and Pfizer?",
        "Yet, all this is not new, it had been tried over and over again, since the birth of microbe theory. But, its prologue was AIDS. The appearance of emaciating, immune compromised homosexuals was a god given chance to the drug cartels of the United States of America.",
        "One of their scientist prophets, targeting the Nobel prize (a prize that is more sensational than of intrinsic value to the human race) came up with a fabricated theory that the virus HIV was the cause of AIDS. Furthermore, although there was no evidence of AIDS being transmitted sexually it was proclaimed to be a sexual disease, contracted through touch, kiss, exchange of semen or even use of toilet seats.",
        "But what was AIDS? Did AIDS have a specific symptom that differentiated it from other diseases? Had the modern microbe hunters (scientist) discovered a specific AIDS virus?",
        "Negative. AIDS was not one particular disease but a name given to a series of symptoms that appeared simultaneously in the homosexual milieu. The symptoms that corroborated to become AIDS was Kaposi’s sarcoma, pneumonia, tuberculosis and shingles.",
        "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS, as it became commonly known, were symptoms common to chemotherapy patients. But, in the 1970’s, these symptoms were seen in another population group; homosexual men.Though many commonalities existed between these men, only sexual promiscuity was taken as a common denominator. And the proclamation ‘sexually transmitted disease’ was readily made and a test soon devised (like the PCR of today) to identify the hypothetical causational microbe. HIV won the race.",
        "Though HIV negatives got AIDS too, they were delisted. The sensation was greater with a ‘one disease, one virus’ marketing campaign. And all HIV positive homosexuals were put on death row. The campaign did not end with homosexuals, it was announced that they would pass the disease to heterosexuals, wives and prostitutes. Eventually, all of humanity would be dead. In the meantime, the scramble for a drug began.",
        "Yet, that what the world was not informed of was that these homosexuals were indiscriminate users of the recreational drug known as ‘Poppers’, made from nitro glycerides. ’Poppers’ were effective in dilating the anal sphincter and extending sexual pleasure. It was a common recreational drug among US homosexuals. The damage and degeneration caused to capillaries by the uninhibited usage of ‘Poppers’ was indicated by the appearance of Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions and pneumocystis carinii, a fungal pneumonia; common only to the severely immune compromised.",
        "Immune deficiency was uncommon to the majority which lived within prescribed behavioral norms. That it was not anal sex but sexual stimulators which caused AIDS was not divulged to the general public.  Instead, they were mentally tortured with the lie that HIV was equal to AIDS after an incubation period of zero years to ten or more.",
        "The Long incubation theory was good for drug profits. A highly toxic drug, Azidothymidine (AZT) developed by the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious disease (NIAID) Anthony Fauci (also the prophet of the covid narrative), at exorbitant cost, was administered to all HIV positives, both symptomatic or asymptomatic.",
        "AZT could not have cured AIDS for AIDS was not caused by nature, but lifestyle choices. AZT should have landed in the dustbin of pharmaceutical discoveries, but it was hyped and sold to thousands of healthy HIV positives. Every one of them who was given AZT is now dead. Those who survived, such as Magic Johnson, discontinued the drug. Freddy Mercury died from AZT, not AIDS. Rock Hudson, who gave AIDS a face, was a ‘Popper’ user. And, it was never made public that his longtime sexual partner got no AIDS. AIDS was never a sexually transmitted. It was a creation of recreational and pharmaceutical drugs.",
        "Then, the WHO took AIDS to Africa. A public smear campaign, associating Black Africa with promiscuity, sexual savagery and compulsive hedonism was started. ‘AIDS IN AFRICA, A killer Rages On’. When the then Sunday Times medical correspondent flew to Africa to study AIDS, the answer he got from all, to nature of their disease was the one word, ‘AIDS’. But, when he studied the nature of African Aids, what he found was tuberculosis, chronic diarrhea, malaria, leprosy, malnutrition etc. He concluded the article saying, ‘all these diseases had been known in Africa for ages. But, in the new hype of pharmaceutical scramble preceded by fear mongering, every disease that had existed since the birth of human time was called ‘AIDS’.",
        "AIDS was a rebranding of old disease. Like Corona. A cough, a cold and the loss of taste was given a name and christened through the PCR test. PCR’s efficacy in detecting infection was notoriously fallacious, even its founder, Kerry Mullis stated, ‘To get some big numbers for HIV positive cases in Africa before they realized that antibodies to malaria – which everyone in Africa has – show up as PCR positive tests’.",
        "And, it is happening, in our country, again. Open the daily newspapers, ‘AIDS on the rise’, is a favourite front page headline. It is not AIDS that is one the rise, it is testing. Obviously, someone somewhere is making quick buck as long as virus mania is rages.",
        "The harm caused by vaccines are unsurmountable and can no longer be misinterpreted. Yet, many still use euphemisms or imagined variables to rationalized post Covid jab diseases. I was recently in the company of a couple, both Covid jabbed for the purpose of foreign travel where the husband, since the jabs suffers regular respiratory disease pathology. Knowing their vaccination history, I suggested to the vaccination being the probable cause and was about to suggest a method of amelioration when his wife attacked my hypothesis and manifested her own. ‘He gets these coughs because he doesn’t wear a mask when he takes the lift to his office’.",
        "This person is 64 years old. He has gone in many lifts. Until the age of Covid, the lift has not caused respiratory disease in him or any other. Yet, what the ‘Age of Covid’ has done is to make everyman a suspect. Not of being a regular terrorist, but one that uses biological weapons; the natural viral composition of his human nature to attack another.",
        "Few understand science as few understood God. God was created for the purpose of men becoming better through transcendental truth and science was created for men to near empirical truth. But, the supposed science of today is not truth, it is dogma. Scientific standards and jargon are used to deceive a public long disinterested in the pursuit of truth, but embroiled in the pursuit of digital sensationalism, identity politics and fake social justice theories that separate the ‘I’ from the world in which it lives.",
        "Man is no longer a pilgrim upon a spiritual journey called life, but a puppet on a string in the Age of Disinformation.  Have we ever bothered to inquire as to why mankind suffers from disease that were rarely a topic before the emergence of the free market economy in our country? Then, except for acutes, we barely had chronic disease. Today, we are animated textbooks of chronic disease. Doctors and health care pundits claim that these have been caused by life style changes, but is it not equally probable that they have been caused by drugs?",
        "Many in our country pop a Panadol for painless sleep at night like a faithful saying a prayer. But, while prayer does not damage the liver, Panadol does. Why do so many women suffer fatty livers? We are not a nation female alcohol consumerism. Why are so many children on brain changing psychiatric drugs? What is this child’s prognosis in five, ten, fifteen years when his liver cannot cope with detoxification and his brain gets the sluggishness and senility of a liver cirrhotic? Have parents ever question the damages they cause to their children by giving them Ritalin?",
        "A friend recently said to me that his grandfather had little wound on his ankle that always opened. When he asked him why he did nothing about it, the grandfather’s repones was, If I close it here it will come out somewhere else, here I can see it and manage it, if it goes elsewhere, it can be fatal’. Did men of yesteryear have greater wisdom than those of today, even without universal education and prestigious foreign university degrees?",
        "‘They put the bible into our hands and taught us how to pray, when we opened our eyes, we had the bible, they had the land?’ Today, we pray to science. Have we learned their methods and lost our insight and common sense? Do we know what drugs we get for cancers? Do we know what is sold to our free national health care system? Or if they are safe. Have we ever considered if nature or allopathic drugs cause severe morbidity? Have we inquired from young mothers what vaccine caused the personality change of her child, which was gladly diagnosed as Autism?",
        "Ivan IIlich writes in his book, the ‘Medical Nemesis’, ‘Before, he who got sick could still find in the eyes of the doctor a reflection of his own anguish and some recognition for the uniqueness of his suffering. Now, what he meets is the gaze of a biological accountant engaged in the input/output calculations.’",
        "Quo vadis Domine? Kanthi returned to be crucified the second time. With the first vaccine she got a turbo cancer. Its medical intervention caused a brain tumor. The resulting epileptic seizure killed her. Jesus fortunately left no children; he had the freedom to return to Rome to be crucified the second time. Kanthi did not want to, but was given no choice. Without the jab, she was not allowed entry to the house in which she was a servant. She had two young sons; she needed that money. A poor widow of 45 years from Obeysekera town in Colombo. Her mother wailed as the cortege left.  Kanthi was her only daughter.",
        "A human life is not born from artificial intelligence, it is born into the unit of the family; the hearth of trust, loyalty, reverence and duty. Kanthi was unable to fulfill her duty, either to her children or to her mother. She died crying, not for the sorrow of death, but the sorrow of unfulfilled duty. Her husband met an equal fate. He died from a sepsis that was left untreated until PCR test clearance. It was negative. By then, he was dead.",
        "It is not silence we need; it is a public inquiry and policy that makes every public official accountable to the crimes he commits against us. Another Nurnberg.",
        "Health has been damaged, lives have been lost, people and countries in dire economic straits. Yet the WHO, its perpetrator, carries on. Its General Director has now called out another emergency; MPox. Its outbreak is in the Congo. A region in the darkest of Africa with the poorest of the poor, for decades been subjected to poverty and duress by its inhuman Belgian colonial masters, where western pharmaceutical giants outsource vaccination experiments through mushroom laboratories on unsuspecting Africans for a dime.",
        "The emergency was announced although the majority of the WHO scientists were against it. Mpox (a new rendering of Monkey Pox) cases have appeared in Sweden and in Pakistan. Yet, it is also claimed to be a disease affecting Homosexuals. Could it not be caused by Herpes Zoster, commonly known as shingles? For who suffers it, Africans suffering malnutrition and Gays. The symptomology is the same. The excruciating pain is the same. But the General Director of the WHO wants an emergency. For that emergency he can instruct the PCR test to find that what he wants. He wants Monkey Pox. So be it!",
        "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is accountable, not to public health but his most lucrative donor; Bill Gates. This man, like a parasite is creeping into our agricultural sector through another non-governmental organization, the USAID.  Should he succeed, our destiny is that of the Osage.  On that tone, to whom is Ravi Kumudesh accountable? Our Health Ministry’s God father of PCR testing, despite information sent, doubting its efficacy, he continuously advocated PCR testing. Who is his donor?",
        "The WHO is preparing for a ‘One Health’ plan; a power grab in the form of a ‘Pandemic Preparedness Treaty’. To abort that, we must be prepared. For should our representatives ratify it, the WHO would transition us from dictatorship to totalitarianism; the Ideology made up of Lies."

        "Sri Lanka is currently on a path to establishing a government free of injustice, nepotism, fraud, bribery, and all forms of corruption. For this ambitious goal to be achieved, individuals of impeccable character must hold government positions, and citizens must likewise adopt a mindset that supports integrity and accountability in all capacities. Achieving a truly corruption-free state requires that the ruling party remain open to constructive criticism, and that its supporters welcome such feedback without becoming sycophants—rejecting good advice or silencing critics.",
        "Lawyer Nagananda, a respected attorney in both Sri Lanka and England, is widely known for his unwavering commitment to fighting injustice and corruption in all its forms. His constructive criticism is imparted without bias toward any individual or party. Consequently, he has often been regarded as an enemy by many, finding support only among a few rational-minded individuals.",
        "In 2019, Nagananda’s bid for the presidency was derailed, he was barred from practicing law in Sri Lanka, and his honesty and integrity were questioned. Despite these obstacles, he has consistently advocated for the rights of the Sri Lankan people. Misinformation, mischaracterization, and malicious lies have clouded his message. This interview aims to clarify the doubts surrounding him and highlight his enduring commitment to justice, which long predates his entry into politics. A man’s character is not built overnight; Nagananda’s past actions speak volumes about his steadfastness to justice. All statements he makes here are backed by hard evidence and provided with references.",
        "Q. You are a British-qualified practicing solicitor and a Sri Lankan-qualified Attorney at Law. Many youths today may not know your background prior to leaving for the United Kingdom. Could you elaborate on your past profession in Sri Lanka and what compelled you to move to the UK?",
        "A: By the time I left for the UK in September 2001, I was the head of the customs serious frauds investigation unit then known as RTF (Revenue Task Force) of Sri Lanka Customs. It was the then Director General of Customs WDL Perera who was compelled to ask the UK government to provide me protection in the UK explaining life-threats faced by me for being uncompromising in my over 2 decades long anti-corruption campaign (Ref: 1). Just two weeks after my departure, the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her Cabinet was condemned in the parliament by the opposition MPs for their failure to provide adequate protection and to retain my service for the country. Throughout my career I had to face a sustained persecution under each and every regime beginning from President J R Jayawardena and culminating with President Chandrika Kumaratunga. I was interdicted 3 times and dismissed twice on the orders of the Executive Presidents but reinstated each time on Court Orders (Ref: 2)",
        "In 1986, I was framed in a bribery case and taken into Custody. Whilst in remand custody in the Welikada Remand Prison I was kept in the death-row cells for my own safety. The politico-business-mafia kept me out of service for 6 years and my studies at the Law college had been stopped for 10 years. In the UK I had to start my career from the beginning and ended up qualified as a Solicitor in England and Wales.",
        "It is pertinent to mention that I had to resort to legal action against the Home Secretary UK for turning down my application for protection in the UK. And it was the judiciary that decided in my favour after the 18-page judgment by the Court is a testimony of dedicated service under trying circumstances in the Customs Administration of Sri Lanka.",
        "In 2004 I was served with a vacation of post notice when I asked time to keep away from Service as one Mr Sarath Jayathilake who had contributed to my exit had been made the Director General of Customs.",
        "Q.  What made you come back to Sri Lanka and give up your UK residency?",
        "I became a British citizen in 2007 and after 2009 I received a written request from the then President Rajapakse’s Secretary, Lalith Weeratunga through an email to return to Sri Lanka and to join the ‘Nation building effort’. I returned to Sri Lanka and had a one-to-one talk with President Rajapakse and agreed to return to service subject to the condition that there would be no interference whatsoever. Yet, PB Jayasundara, the then Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, vehemently objected to my return to Customs administration and with that my career in the public service came to an end. Since then, I started working in both England and Sri Lanka as a lawyer and finally decided to engage in the legal profession in Sri Lanka, particularly in the public interest litigations which I did absolutely on pro bono basis for public good (Ref: 3).",
        "I was the only lawyer to do so and I brought up over 40 public interest litigations, each one of which was on matters affecting the helpless citizens of Sri Lanka. In short, I had to fight against all three organs of the government (Legislative, Executive and the Judiciary) for the first time in the legal history of Sri Lanka.",
        "Q.  Most Sri Lankan voters do not know the history of the people to whom they cast their votes or do not care to learn it. This situation is further exacerbated by their readiness to believe rumors and unfounded accusations of politicians they do not support and stay completely blind to their own party members. Therefore, I want to ask you directly about your first presidential contest. Why were you unable to participate, and what did you do after realizing that you could not run? How did you address the concerns of those who relied on you and raised funds on your behalf?",
        "I did my best to contest the Presidential Election 2019 and there was a huge public interest both in Sri Lanka and abroad to my election campaign purely based on rule of law and peoples’ Constitution designed to be adopted by the people. As required by law, I had to contest through a political party and the Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya strongly recommended to me a party named Okkoma Vasio belonged to one Dr Taminimulle from Kandy. However, this person at the 11th hour let me and all my followers down and refused nomination through his party which was a heavy blow. This was the culmination of a well-laid out plan guided by Mahinda Deshapriya, Rajapakse brothers, a person named Oshala Herath and Malimawa, who considered my campaign based on rule of law as a real threat to their progression.",
        "As the campaign was abruptly stopped, I had to bear outstanding payments for social media channels and printers from my own funds. The total collection of funds for the Presidential Election from 2017 to 2019 October was approximately 13 million rupees and a fully audited report of accounts by a chartered auditors was submitted to the Election Commission (Ref: 4) and published in the Vinivida Foundation website as well.",
        "On the nomination day I made a complaint against Taminimulle for the criminal breach of trust to the Election Commission (Ref:5) and a criminal case was initiated against him in the Magistrate’s Court which is due to resume on 2nd December 2024 after dismissal of all his appeals to the Court of Appeal (Ref: 6) and Provincial High Court, Western Province (Ref. 7) against the interim order made against him by the Magistrate (Ref. 8).",
        "The conspirators knew that had I tendered my nomination I would have definitely stopped Ghotabhaya Rajapakse’s nomination as he was a dual citizen by then not renouncing his US citizenship. None of the 36 candidates had a backbone to bring this out on the nomination day which was a crime committed against the citizenry.",
        "Oshala Herath who engaged in a character assassination campaign after the denial of my nomination was charged for defamation along with Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the matter is still pending in the civil appellate high Court Colombo. The reading of the complaint will enlighten you on this charge (Ref: 9)",
        "Q.  Why did you not run for the presidency this time? What prevented you, and why did you not foresee these barriers?",
        "The Election Commission refused registration of our party Vinivida Foundation twice and now it has been charged before the Supreme Court (Ref: 10) and the matter is still pending. Even this time (2024) I tried hard to get hold of a registered political party, which included the Communist Party and the Samasamaja Party but no one was willing to give without a big fee. I know of a person who has paid 60 million to a leftist party to contest the 2024 Presidential Election through that party.",
        "As cited above, I was the only public interest litigation activist who fearlessly dealt with people occupying public office in the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary for the commission of the criminal offence of corruption. The enclosure (Ref: 3) attached here vividly displays this higher to unparallel record.",
        "Q.  Anura Kumara has provided the people of Sri Lanka with an alternative path, filled with hope, success, and prosperity. His main political theme was \"a country free of corruption.\" Under what theme would you have run if you had decided to enter the race?",
        "Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is yet to prove that he was different from the other corrupt politicians in Sri Lanka. However, in the past he had committed serious violations and financial frauds which were unpardonable. He could have easily stopped Gotabhaya Rajapakse from contesting Presidential Election in 2019 and he should not have got involved with Ranil Wickremasinghe’s attempt to usurp the powers of the Executive President by unlawful means.",
        "Of the same bunch of politicians accused of looting the country, whereas Nagananda is an activist lawyer whose campaign from day one was to establish a nation that respects the sovereignty of the people and the rule of law. The sole objective of the People’s Constitution designed by the Vinivida Foundation was to make it the supreme law of the land with a clear people’s mandate at the Presidential Election. Even at this (2024) Presidential Election it was offered to Malimawa but it declined the offer. And then one Prof Lalith de Silva was willing to put it to the people seeking their approval but he lacked the necessary characteristics to persuade the citizenry to accept it and make the Supreme Law of the Land.",
        "Q.  You are now running as a candidate from your new party. What are you offering that is different from other candidates?",
        "The Election Commission twice refused to register Vinivida Foundation, despite fulfilling all the requirements for registration. It has registered 7 new parties that, compared to Vinivida Foundation, have done nothing for public good. In this backdrop Vinivida Foundation was compelled to contest from one of the other registered political parties namely United National Freedom Front at the 2024 parliamentary election.",
        "Our objective is to motivate the people to demand for a system change that respects the norm of representative democracy with due regard and respect to the sovereignty of the people, the rule of law and public trust doctrine, the foundation on which the people’s Constitution is formulated.",
        "Q.  Should the NPP party secure a 2/3 majority or just a simple majority? Shouldn't the Sri Lankan people give the NPP an opportunity to govern, to eradicate corruption and bring prosperity?",
        "It is apparent that the NPP administration has missed the greatest opportunity it had to turn the tables in the endangered political system of Sri Lanka. Had they presented the People’s Constitution to the people seeking a clear mandate at the Presidential Election – 2024 by now it would have been the Supreme Law of the Land. In such a scenario the NPP’s governance would have been much easier since all the traps set out by JR Jayawardena would have been thrown to the dustbin of history by the sovereign people themselves.",
        "No political party that has tasted the fruits of corruption will back the total independence of the judiciary, breaking away from the clutches of the other two organs, which they perceive as a threat to their survival.",
        "The NPP has to prove itself as and when it gets its proposed Constitution ready for approval of the people. It is observed that despite NPP being in active mainstream politics for decades it did nothing when Gotabhaya Rajapakse removed the Constitutional Council through his 20th Amendment denying judiciary and other so-called independent Commissions their liberty and freedom to perform office independently it did not challenge the same for its constitutionality. I must state that even before I left for England in September 2001 my uncompromising attitude and steadfastness with due respect to the rule of law was the same without which fighting against corruption cannot be accomplished.",
        "The naked truth is that without going for a true system no one would be able to guarantee the judiciary with total freedom from the other two organs with due respect and regard to the doctrine of separation of power which has includes the judicial review i.e., to review any law enacted by the legislature for the constitutionality. In my view, even if NPP wants to fight corruption it will not succeed as the system itself under the existing Constitution encourages corruption with no accountability, transparency backed by sanctions are in place.",
        "Q.  The Sri Lankan people have not yet learned to discuss or debate politics in a civil manner without resorting to personal insults against the opposition. They also exhibit a sycophantic mentality toward their leaders. Supporters often do not appreciate it when the governing party is questioned, viewing such inquiries as threats or as support for opposing parties. Many questions about misconduct are met with responses asking why the previous government was not questioned over similar issues or how such actions were tolerated then but not now. How can we change this trend, especially when it comes to the youth, who often lack any knowledge of history, civic rights, and the ability to conduct proper research and argue logically?",
        "Absolutely correct. Apparently the print and electronic media have failed their role and not encouraging the people to be assertive and to demand the government to be accountable to the people, the supreme body of representative democracy. The people have not been taught that in a system of governance based on the norm of democracy people are expected to respect the views of opposing parties. Whereas in this country the print and electronic media which include the social media is being abused to the maximum and it has become the accepted norm of the day, compelling the new law, namely the Online Safety Act came into being with penal sanctions provided against abuse of freedom of speech and expression.",
        "The Constitution requires every citizen to respect, honour and defend the rights of other citizens to fight for their rights (Article 28) and requires every citizen to engage in his or her chosen occupation with due respect and regard to the rights of the others in practice it is not seen anywhere. Although the said Article requires citizens to commit themselves to fight corruption and protect nature, 9 out of 10 people are unaware of this constitutional mandate. Therefore, there is a great deal the media is expected to play in this regard in educating the people about their duties and responsibilities. Unfortunately, the media is equally corrupt and turns a blind eye simply playing a passive role.",
        "Q.  Finally, if you are elected to parliament, you may find yourself a lone voice in the wilderness. Can you play an effective role alone? Will you be a one-man army, or will you seek support from the opposition?",
        "Sadly, but faithful to the nation I must say this to my people.  In the past this beautiful nation had people stupendously honest, and faithful to their motherland but not anymore and it is almost impossible to find people who perform faithfully in whatever their chosen occupations whether it is in party politics and even outside of politics. Because the noble dhamma based on the law of nature is no more in actual practice.",
        "Vinivida Foundation and Nagananda, strong advocators of the rule of law, doctrine of public trust, doctrine and accountability, transparency and separation of powers, will do its utmost best to reestablish a system of governance treat every citizen, including those in politics, equally and support any political party or organization that respects these views which a must to establish a true representative democracy that respect the will of the people. Unfortunately, in this country people seem to believe that the politicians are from different classes and they deserve special treatment with a right to abuse the wealth of the nation for their private benefit.",

        "ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka Podujana Party’s younger members are pushing for more liberal ideas in a globalized world from within, says Milinda Rajapaksa, a party activist and vocal leader representing the group.",
        "Following the currency collapse, shortages and high inflation under the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the party split with a faction supporting ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the last election, while its own candidate Namal Rajapaksa trailed far behind.",
        "The younger members are undaunted and are looking to change the direction of the party, he says. Since SLPP is a democratic party, some will entertain different views, suggestions and ideologies.",
        "“They are the young people who are very pro LGBT rights,” Rajapaksa says. “They are the young people who are very pro of a small government. They are the young people who think SOE reforms are necessary.",
        "“They are the young people who think we should cultivate more and more liberal political values. They are the young people, the name of our student wing is Social Democratic Student Union. So you know where our student wing stands in terms of ideology.”",
        "The younger members as a group now are big enough to make the change, he says.",
        "“SLPP is a party which loves the nation. And that is why we could easily support President Ranil Wickremesinghe Especially the younger lot of our party went out of the way to support President Wickremesinghe’s economic policies. And big parties like us have different political ideas, beliefs.",
        "In the list fielded for the November general election 103 candidates are aged below 40.",
        "“I can easily add another 40-50 candidates if we take the age under 45,” Rajapaksa says.",
        "“So, this is probably the youngest list of candidates if you compare it with other mainstream political parties. So imagine the youthful power.”",
        "The SLPP made a mistake in departing from Mahinda Rajapaksa’s more centrist policies towards nationalism, he says, and not giving enough room for private enterprise.",
        "“I have learnt very good lessons associating the last two governments, Mahindra Rajapaksa’s government and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government, especially what went wrong with them,” Rajapaksa says frankly.",
        "The large public service, the way people had to bear the cost of state-owned enterprises were examples.",
        "“Then we didn’t allow the private sector to thrive in this country,” Rajapaksa says.",
        "“Then the way we blocked the private capital getting involved in sectors like education and those industries. And then how the government intervened in the commercial affairs of this country.”",
        "And all these things systematically built corruption. Build unwanted political authority over everything in our lives. Without changing this political culture, I don’t think we can manage the economic issues. This is not an economic issue. This is an issue of the political economy.”",
        "Colombo has special needs as a large number of people flow in every year from every part of the country to fulfill their ideas.",
        "Rajapaksa says there should be liberty, equality and justice to give everyone an equal opportunity to achieve their dreams.",
        "“So, how are we going to make the policies of this city which respect the liberty of people regardless where they are coming from, which ethnicity they belong to, whom they know?”",
        "It is unfortunate that the first thing that young people who get married do is to set up a fake address to get their children into a good school.",
        "This year in elections however, policies do not really matter, he says.",
        "“If people went on policies, probably Ranil Wickremesinghe would have scored the best because he ran on the policy platform,” Rajapaksa says.",
        "“So, these elections in Sri Lanka are mostly about who they are against or which party or people they protest. That is how the elections are determined in Sri Lanka.”",
        "But he says on the ground, economic matters would be the main underlying driver in the near term.",
        "“I think the economy is going to be the central issue in the coming two or three years.”",
        "“The issue is, the next parliament is going to have at least 75 parliamentarians who haven’t even been a leader of a cooperative society.",
        "“So, politics outside the parliament is going to be very important. So, I think whether we go to the parliament or not, it is important how we rally people around political values which protect the Sri Lankan identity and the liberal democracy.” (Colombo/Nov10/2024)"

        "The agency is to appoint a new head, a serving Deputy Inspector-General (DIG), to replace Suresh Sallay, a controversial retired major general. Sallay was appointed to the top post by Gotabaya Rajapaksa when he became president in November 2019.",
        "With the appointment of a DIG, the SIS returns to the orbit of the police after being under military influence for nearly four years.",
        "Gotabaya had blamed Sallay’s SIS for intelligence failures that led to his toppling in July 2022, following months of street protests against acute shortages of food, fuel, and medicines amid the country’s worst economic crisis.",
        "Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, not only retained Sallay but also granted him an extension after he retired from active service in the army.",
        "The influential Catholic Church has opposed the retention of Sallay, accusing him of involvement in the Easter Sunday bombings.",
        "Sally has denied the allegations and counter sued Caltholic priests.",
        "The Criminal Investigation Division (CID), which was then headed by Ravi Seneviratne, concluded that Sallay’s Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) had attempted to mislead those investigating the April 2019 bombings, which killed over 280 people.",
        "Seneviratne’s team of detectives, led by Shani Abeysekera, also found a direct link between DMI operatives and several suicide bombers involved in the most audacious terror attack in the country’s history.",
        "With Seneviratne now heading the Public Security Ministry as its secretary and in charge of the police department, investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks have resumed.",
        "Cabinet spokesman Vijitha Herath told reporters on Tuesday that investigations have resumed. A source close to the case indicated that a breakthrough in the investigation is expected shortly."

        "The Bishop of the Diocese of Mannar and three prominent environmentalists this week petitioned the Supreme Court in the public interest against the proposed 250 MW Mannar Wind Power Project by Adani Green Energy.",
        "Rev. Dr. Fidelis Lionel Emmanuel Fernando along with Rohan Pethiyagoda, Prof. Nimal Gunatilleke and Prof. Sarath Kotagama have challenged the procurement process and proposed construction of the project by Adani Green Energy PTE Ltd and/or Adani Green Energy S L Limited.",
        "The case names 67 respondents including the Cabinet of Ministers, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), the Board of Investment, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Public Utilities Commission Sri Lanka and the Attorney General, among others.",
        "It raises concerns regarding the credibility of the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the role played by the SLSEA. It flags certain procedural issues in the awarding of the purported contract and questions the characterisation of the project as a government-to-government deal.",
        "It questions the basis for the negotiated tariff to be fixed at USD 8.26 cents per kilowatt-hour for a period of 20 years when the EIA conducts its assessment based on a cost of USD 4.6 cents, potentially causing considerable financial loss to the country and a burden on consumers.",
        "The petition also states that, notwithstanding the intensely public nature of the project, its vital importance to the general public and public resources, including the natural environment, as well as the paramountcy of transparency and openness in good governance, “there is a paucity of available data and information”.",
        "It requests Court to compel the release of the entire files and records including the call for bids for (if any) and responses to both the Mannar and proposed 234MW Pooneryn plants; records of deliberations and negotiations; Cabinet memoranda and decisions; unit price discussions including formulae related to the computation of the price per kilowatt hour; the criteria and benchmarks or any other basis for assessments of the project; and other relevant information.",
        "The petition holds that the EIA commissioned by the SLSEA “appears to be a formality, conducted with a premeditated intention/decision to award the construction and operation of the project to predetermined contractors”.",
        "Despite the CEA being the designated body, it appears from publicly disseminated information that the Power and Energy Minister was de facto acting in the capacity of the project approving authority, it states.",
        "There is no transparency surrounding the purported leasing of 202 hectares acquired on Mannar Island for the project; and no information on compensation payable to affected landowners, the cost of which should be recovered from the investor.",
        "The EIA has also not adequately evaluated alternative sites—Ambewela, the South East coast, Kalpitiya and Jaffna—or expressed “any acceptable rationale” for why Mannar Island was chosen.",
        "“The promotion of Mannar when compared to other sites is made even more confounding given that it is the focal point of the Central Asian Flyway for over five million [5,000,000] migratory birds travelling to, and through, Mannar island on an annual basis, making it a crucial area for conservation and tourism which aspects are not as markedly evident in the other sites considered,” the petition states.",
        "In seeking their relief, the petitioners pray that the Supreme Court declares a violation of their fundamental rights and that of the citizenry at large and the decisions made to award the project to Adani as wrongful; and calls for any consequential actions undertaken to be declared illegal.",
        "The petition states that the case has been filed to further the national interest, to preserve and protect public property, including the environment, flora and fauna, public finances and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the general public of Sri Lanka and its future generations."

These include radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors and entomology officers.",

This move, raising the allowance from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000, has fueled discontent among other health sector professionals who feel that their contributions have been overlooked."

As Professor Henpitagedara Gnanavasa Thero emphasized in 1983, addressing economic problems collectively is key to fostering societal peace and happiness,” he said.",
        "Wickremesinghe invited all parties represented in parliament to support the reforms.",
        "“We’re diligently strengthening the economy each day, striving tirelessly to improve the lives of our people and fortify the economy. Our actions are guided by a strategic plan, ensuring a systematic and methodical approach,” he said.",
        "“Some suggest retail solutions or collecting funds from Sri Lankans abroad, but these are deemed inadequate by those with economic knowledge. Currently, we must decide whether to continue on our current path, reaping the benefits of our economic trajectory, or risk returning to a state of distress,” he added.",
        "The president claimed that it is “widely acknowledged” that Sri Lanka has achieved a certain level of economic stability.",
        "“However, there are individuals who criticize the programs we enact without demonstrating acceptance of them. Despite the apparent strength of the economy, there are accusations that the general populace isn’t experiencing its benefits. Furthermore, there are claims of unnecessary tax burdens on the people, as well as excessive hikes in electricity bills and fuel prices.",
        "“There’s a commonly held belief that taxes should be collected from the people gently, akin to plucking flowers without crushing them. However, criticism is directed towards us for not adhering to this principle. Yet, it’s important to note that these critics overlook the opportunities available to harvest flowers while crushing them to generate revenue. This lesson is quite profound. Under typical conditions, it’s feasible to extract nectar without damaging the flowers. However, in the intermediate space, this isn’t always possible, as the situation differs significantly,” said Wickremesinghe. (Colombo/Mar06/2024)"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The government is being very rational in its actions whether in dealing with the economy, the travel advisories or the reconciliation process, and is reaping the rewards. Its victory at the local council election in Elpitiya is an indication that its popularity after a month in power is continuing and that it is not confined to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake alone but extends to the NPP itself. The margin of victory on this occasion was much greater than the last time it faced such local elections. The NPP was able to increase the number of its seats to 15 from two in the last council, which was elected in 2019, and obtained nearly 48 percent of the vote compared to six percent in 2019.",
        "The enhanced victory margin for the NPP at the local council election would be due to the calculation of voters that they would be better off voting for NPP candidates in the aftermath of the victory at the presidential election of the NPP candidate. It would also be due to general satisfaction that the new government is performing its tasks effectively. It was rational of the new government to retain the economic team that negotiated with the IMF during the worst period and which has the confidence of the IMF and its international backers. The government thereby belied the fears that it would have a confrontation with the IMF and take the country back to economic chaos. The international community has expressed its satisfaction by investing in Sri Lanka, as done visibly by the Japanese government which restarted 11 stalled projects.",
        "The government has also dealt competently with the unexpected challenge that arose due to the travel advisories by the US and several other Western countries due to a threat of terrorism after intelligence reports. The US advisory stated that “The Embassy received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area. Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice. U.S. citizens are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice.”",
        "This was followed by the Israeli government issuing its own warning to Israeli citizens and asking them to leave the country or to move to Colombo where there was greater security. This indicated the possibility of violence against Israeli tourists. Some of whom have overstayed their visas and are engaging in business in the east of the country. They have also been building prayer houses in the area which has traditionally been a Muslim majority area. Instead of engaging in recriminations against the foreign embassies that issued the travel advisories at the height of the tourist season, the government did its work in providing the necessary security without fanfare.",
        "While the terror threat appears to have been dealt with following the recent warnings, it is important to deal with reportedly unregistered and unregulated tourism run foreign run businesses in the East and elsewhere. It was also reported that many of those who overstay their tourist visas from many other countries have foreign bank accounts, foreign credit card machines, foreign currency cash payments and other methods of effecting financial transfers overseas. These unregulated activities pose a serious threat to the local tourism industry, which needs to be dealt with forthwith by the new government devoid of political patronage and in association with immigration and financial sectors.",
        "In eastern Sri Lanka, where a significant Muslim population resides, the addition of synagogues or Chabad Houses near mosques might indeed be perceived by some as intrusive or provocative, particularly given recent global tensions. The sensitivities of the local Muslim population need to be prioritised. However, it is noteworthy that the reaction of the local population in the area has also been rational. The people in the affected areas have appreciated the business being brought in by the Israelis and other tourists and do not wish to see it endangered. After the economic collapse of 2022, the people throughout the country appear to be more rational and less emotional, especially about economic matters.",
        "A similar phenomenon was to be observed at a recent seminar attended by young people from around the country. They belonged to all ethnic and religious communities. The significance of their interaction was that they did not seem to have suspicions or mistrust of each other’s communities or religions. The issues revolving around the plural nature of Sri Lankan society and the political structures that were needed to accommodate this diversity was discussed in a rational manner. The new government needs to take up this challenge. The building blocks of national reconciliation and a political solution to the ethnic conflict appear to be within reach.",
        "The call by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to provincial governors and other officials to enhance their governance roles has been accompanied by his pledge to hold the long postponed provincial council elections in the coming year. This position taken by the president is likely to be welcomed by the Tamil and Muslim voters in the northern and eastern provinces in particular. The provincial council system is not only about decentralised governance, it is also about devolved governance which means that decisions are taken by those elected at the provincial level. According to this logic, directives from the central government are unlikely to fulfill the purpose of the provincial council system, which is to empower local representatives elected by the people, not officials appointed by the President.",
        "One of the most common criticisms against the provincial council system is its cost. It is argued that this additional layer of governance is a financial burden on an already strained national budget. However, while cost-efficiency is a legitimate concern, focusing solely on the financial aspect risks overlooking the deeper value of political empowerment and economic equity. A closer look at political and economic centralisation is that it has led to substantial disparities that perpetuates economic inequality and, more crucially, the sense of political exclusion that led to three decades of civil war. Viewed in the international context, power-sharing through decentralised governance has become a norm in multicultural and multiethnic societies including those in India which is huge in size and Switzerland which is smaller than Sri Lanka.",
        "Switzerland has 26 cantons, each with significant autonomy. This structure empowers cantons with authority over areas like health, education, and policing. The Swiss Constitution outlines which powers are reserved for the federal government, while all other powers remain with the cantons, providing local governments substantial freedom in decision-making. In Sri Lanka, on the other hand, the central government retains significant control over most functions, with issues like defense, finance, and national policy tightly centralised. The Provincial Councils have some authority over local matters such as agriculture, education, and health, but their powers are limited compared to the Swiss cantons.",
        "The need for a decentralised government is more urgent than ever, particularly as Sri Lanka grapples with the demand from the people for “system change” and from the ethnic minorities for the devolution of power. The centralised governance model, dominant since the British departure, has created significant political and economic imbalances. While Colombo has developed into a bustling hub of growth and modernisation, many of the provinces remain economically marginalised and politically disempowered, with limited capacity to address local issues effectively. Centralised decision-making has often proven to be inadequate in addressing the needs of diverse ethnic and regional communities across the country, exacerbating economic disparities and fueling social unrest.",
        "For instance, policies affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and education can vary greatly in urgency and relevance from one province to another, depending on local needs. Clearly the needs in the hill country will be different from the coastal areas. Appointed governors may be effective administrators but often lack the nuanced understanding and deep-rooted commitment to local issues that elected officials possess. The provincial council system’s purpose is to allow locally elected representatives to be decision-makers, making it necessary to restore these councils and avoid diluting their autonomy with central appointments. Reviving the provincial council system and empowering it with both fiscal and administrative autonomy could usher in a new era of governance in Sri Lanka—one that aligns with the aspirations of all communities and facilitates regional development.",

He further stated that multiple provisions of the bill confers on the executive, the judicial power of the people contrary to article 4 of the Constitution.",

        "Compared to the excesses of the yahapalana or good governance regime, and the Gotabaya Rajapaksa raj that followed it, the omissions of this government seem trivial and innocent. The NPP is now two months in office, and whether we like it or not, the excitement of those early days is fading away. One can almost see the end of the honeymoon around the corner. The cynics are, of course, growing louder. They are all speaking with one voice – and in one tongue – and they are all saying that the government is doing precious little.",
        "The Speaker of the Parliament must be beyond reproach. He must be like Caesar’s wife, and above suspicion. It does not do for someone constitutionally bound to integrity to lie about his credentials, as his critics allege him, and the government of which he is a part, as having done. Moreover, to me, the doctorate scandal highlights a bigger issue: the obsession that many Sri Lankans, in the public or private sector, have with their qualifications, and the mad rush among many of us to award ourselves honours we either do not have or do not deserve. In this, for better or worse, the Speaker is only too representative of many of his colleagues in parliament, and many of the people he is representing.",
        "Yet once we account for the fact that the NPP/JVP has never been in power before – unless you count the parivasi (probationary) coalition of 2004 – once we acknowledge that the parliament is seeing a plurality of new faces for the first time since 1994, that the old faces have been wiped off from the face of the legislature and a new generation is in charge – once we get around adjusting ourselves to these realities, then we must realise that this too is an elected government, which, like its predecessors, needs to be kept in check.",
        "Much of the criticism of the NPP’s actions, and inactions, come from those who have sinned for far too long to have any semblance of credibility. These are the Ranilists, the Rajapaksists, those who are glad the NPP is in power because that gives them the perfect opportunity to exact revenge on their rivals. The NPP, we must remember, has been in opposition for too long. They have, at every step of the way, pointed out the errors of those in government and the Opposition. When Harsha de Silva questioned the NPP’s ability to lead, Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s response was to band him and Ranil Wickremesinghe together, to liken them to birds of the same feather. Today, however, Dissanayake is President.",
        "If the rise of the populist left hasn’t (yet) united the right, it appears to be doing so. True, the SJB and UNP – or the New Democratic Front (NDF) – don’t seem to be getting together. But some MPs, including certain bigwigs from the SJB, have hinted that they would be open to Ranil Wickremesinghe joining the SJB. These are, to be sure, minority voices. But they can well grow louder if the NPP fails. And the way things stand, the NPP can fail in two ways: it neglects its radical mandate and caves to the right, or it commits the same errors it accused other parties, both in government and Opposition, of doing.",
        "On both counts, the NPP is playing with fire. It has opened itself to misinterpretation and critique, from both the left and right. A good example, perhaps the best one, is the IMF agreement. Now, it is not true that the NPP said at the outset, before it assumed power, that it would exit the IMF. That was never its promise, and to pretend otherwise would be disingenuous. Yet the NPP did give rise to expectations that it would at least talk to the IMF on a possible renegotiation of the terms.",
        "President Dissanayake, to be sure, did stress on the importance of social protection during a meeting with the IMF delegation. Yet the situation has become so complicated that both Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the centre-right Opposition, and Ravi Karunanayake, the former Finance Minister who was at the heart of a financial scandal a decade ago, have questioned the NPP for continuing the reforms of the previous administration. “Don’t signal to the left, and then turn right,” Karunanayake recently advised the NPP.",
        "In this, officials of the Wickremesinghe government have had it both ways – praising the NPP for continuing their reforms, while eviscerating them for their hypocrisy. The People’s Struggle Alliance (PSA) has emerged as the NPP’s critic on the Left, and it too has been vocal in its denunciations. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from all this is that no party can escape the allure of parliamentarianism. As a friend of mine put it, in Sri Lanka it is impossible to do politics without accounting for the vote. And as far as the NPP is concerned, even if they have not entered coalitions with other parties, they have come to power on the strength of the broadest electoral alliance in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history: an eclectic mixture of different, often divergent, class interests.",
        "It is, of course, ironic for a party that called both the UNP and SLFP bourgeois formations in the 1970s – without appreciating the fundamental differences between the two – to cave into the same bourgeois democratic structures it sought to transcend. But this would be a gross misinterpretation of the NPP’s or rather JVP’s history. The JVP did make attempts to re-enter the democratic mainstream – prominently in 1982. But, for close to a decade in the 1980s and early 1990s, it toyed with the idea of going beyond that framework, provoked by the most right-wing authoritarian government Sri Lanka ever elected. Since 1994, it has been trying to course-correct and have it both ways – regain credibility among the masses without going down the route of coalitions and alliances with other formations.",
        "None of this absolves the NPP. It is difficult to defend a government when it falls headlong into one scandal after another. The NPP’s leading faces have all grown silent. Perhaps they have no other choice – they have come to power on the most radical political agenda Sri Lanka has seen since 1970. Does that justify its recent failures, prominently the issue of the Speaker of Parliament? Probably not. As its critics and rivals get together to trip it at every corner, the NPP must realise that it cannot shield itself from censure for long. It must either respond to criticism – as it did, even if half-heartedly, with its statement on the PTA – or it must take decisive action – as it has so far failed to, with the Speaker. The NPP must realise it is no longer in Opposition. It must stop pretending that it is.",

      "original_title": "A US “Kaputa” (Crow) ,a  Lankan “Nariya” (Fox) and a Presidential  Election “Feast”.",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The encounter between  the Fox and Crow is an ancient  tale heard by most Sri Lankans in their childhood days. The crow has a vadai or kavun or piece of cheese in its beak. The crafty fox wants it and flatters the crow into thinking it  is a harmonious singer with a sweet voice. The fox entreats the crow to sing. The  foolishly vain  crow opens its mouth to sing and drops the titbit it has in its beak. The smart fox runs off with it, l eaving behind a dejected crow. This story has been made famous by singers like  MS  Fernando (Sora Gathu Keju Kaala) and AE Manoharan (Ka Kaa Kakakaka Ka Ka Ka) in their songs too.",
        "A modern version of this fable  is currently unfolding in Sri Lanka . In a  reversal of the old  story, the crow tries to deceive the fox now. A  “Kaputa” (Crow) from the US meets with a “Nariya”(Fox) in Sri Lanka. The fox is planning to devour a feast  , fit for a king sorry President. The crow wants to prevent it. So it resorts to many stratagems including a ‘blow hot blow cold” approach to compel the fox from partaking of the presidential feast. This  Americanized crow is regarded  by its followers as a brilliant bird with seven brains.",
        "Despite the US crow’s persistent efforts the Lankan fox does not budge. The wily animal knows that the prospective presidential feast is the best meal it can have in a long,long life of political disappointments. Reynard also knows that the crow though  a tactical ally is actually  a strategic enemy. Hence the Fox gives the crow a patient hearing and then proceeds with preparations to devour the Presidential feast. In spite of racking its seven brains, the outfoxed  crow  is flummoxed and does not know what to do except to get its minions “caw caw” in the media.",
        "Basil Rajapaksa returned amid much political excitement  a few weeks ago to Sri Lanka  after a lengthy stay in Los Angeles.The politically astute Medamulana sibling has a fan club that hailed him once as a seven brained wonder. Much of that sheen has worn off after the “Aragalaya”(Struggle) protests but there are still some “Basilistas” who  think of him as a political genius capable of performing wonderful miracles.",
        "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) is the political party founded by Basil Rajapaksa. He nurtured the party to success  as the SLPP National organizer. The SLPP within a few years of its existence won the majority of councils in the local authority elctions of 2018. The SLPP candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the 2019 presidential election polling 69 Lakhs of votes.",
        "In 2020 the SLPP and its allies won 146 of the 225 seats in Parliament/ Basil was the master strategist who planned and coordinated the campaign. Basil also used the “carrot and stick”method to entice 8 opposition MPs to enable the SLPP Govt to command a two-thirds majority in the House.",
        "A chain is as strong as its weakest link. The seemingly all powerful SLPP regime was headed by autocratic strong man Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Appearances can be deceptive. Instead of being a strong man as projected by his party, Gotabaya proved to  be a weak coward  when faced with a crisis of his own making. He went down in history as the first Sri Lankan president to flee from the country and submit his resignation from foreign soil.",
        "The decline and downfall of the Rajapaksa regime is a well-known matter  that nees no repetition.  Basil himself was forced to resign as Finance minister. Subsequently he quit as national list MP too.",
        "The 21st Constitutional Amendment that debars dual citizens from contesting political positions, has effectively killed Basil’s chances of gaining a powerful De-jure Govt position again. Yet he retains de -faacto political power as the livewire of the SLPP which is still the majority party in Parliament… Mahinda Rajapaksa is the leader of the SLPP but it is Basil who runs the party. Whether this state of affairs will change after Namal Rajapaksa replaced  Basil as SLPP National organizer remains to be seen.",
        "The SLPP was floundering in choppy waters when the Aragalaya storm raged. The party got a lifeline when Ranil Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister and then President. In De Jure terms it was  President Gotabaya who appointed  Ranil as Premier and as acting president. It was the SLPP which voted in large numbers for Wickremesinghe to be elected as President in a Parliamentary vote. Also it is  the support provided by MPs of the  SLPP that enables president Wickremesinghe to pass the Budget and other legislation in Parliament.",
        "The legal position therefore is one of  Ranil Wickremesinghe being backed and supported  as President by the SLPP. Most members of his Govt both cabinet and state ministers  are from the SLPP.After all, Wickremesinghe has only a single MP from the UNP in Parliament. This situation has provided ammunition to Ranil’s detractors in the opposition and the media who attack him as a puppet of the Rajapaksa-led SLPP.",
        "This accusation however  appears incorrect in factual terms. Though compelled at times by practical politics to engage in minor compromises with the Rajapaksa-led SLPP, Wickremesinghe has demonstrated through his presidential conduct that he is no lackey or stooge of the Rajapaksas. Ranil has proved time and again that he is an Independent person who cannot be cowed by the Rajapaksas or the SLPP.  Wickremesinghe does not adopt a confrontational attitude with the Rajapaksas as he needs SLPP cooperation to run the Govt.Nevertheless Wickremesinghe  runs things in his own way especially in the economic sphere.  This is the De-facto position.",
        "Ranil has resisted repeated demands to appoint certain SLPP Parliamentarians as ministers. These disgruntled MPs and Basil’s mouthpiece Sagara Kariyawasam often boast pompously that Wickremesinghe was appointed by the SLPP and that he is their creature but the silent majority within SLPP Members of the Govt have only a healthy respect for Ranil. Having worked closely with him, they are impressed by his knowledge, ability, efficience and ong term vision.",
        "It is only Ranil Wickremesinghe who has a working plan to uplift Sri Lanka from the deep economic morass it has sunk into and lead Lanka on the road to economic recovery. He has been doing this effectively from the time he took over the reins of power. The country got breathing space. Today it is slowly and surely progressing  though it will require at least five more years of Ranil  steering the ship of state for Lanka to reach a satisfactory c  state of affairs economically",
        "Hence the reality is one where  the SLPP has got a reprieve due to Wickremesinghe being at the helm. SLPP Mps who were cowering in fear are now moving about without tre[idation. They are organizing public meetings where people like Namal Rajapaksa and “Ratharang”Rohitha are able to talk tough. All this would not have been possible but for   Ranil. The SLPP owes a political debt to Wickremesinghe. A sizable number of SLPP ministers, state ministers, Govt MPs and MPs in the   opposition realise this.",
        "A new Presidential election is due this year and the incumbent president intends contesting. While the bulk of SLPP parliamentarians are supportive of Ranil, there are others in the “Pohottuwa”camp who are not. It is against this backdrop that SLPP masterbrain  Basil  Rajapaksa returned to Lanka. Thereafter he has engaged in a series of discussions with President Wickremesinghe. This process has been supplemented by several inspired leaks appearing in different sections of the media.",
        "It appears that Basil Rajapaksa has tried in many ways to make Wickremesinghe alter his plans about the Presidential election. Basil  and his acolytes within the SLPP want the Parliamentary election to be held first.",
        "There are two broad reasons. The first is that the SLPP is not in a position to contest and win the presidential poll. The Rajapaksas would always prefer one of the clan to contest. In this case Namal seems to be the obvious choice. Fielding Namal is dicey. If the “rising son”fares miserably in the poll, that may affect his political future.",
        "The other option is to field a non -Rajapaksa “outsider”. But the problem here for the Rajapaksas is tricky. If that candidate does badly it will dampen SLPP’s future electoral prospects. On the other hand if the non -Rajapaksa candidate does well, the Rajapaksas would feel threatened. A SLPP Presidential candidate who garners a large number of votes will gain political strength and legitimacy and  could become a potential aspirant to SLPP leadership. This could prove to be a challenge to Rajapaksa domination in the future.  It may be recalled that when  SLPP dissident MP Dullas Alahapperuma vied for the presidency,  the jittery Rajapaksas opted for Ranil instead of the man from Matara.",
        "The second  broad reason is about the future president.With the prospect of a SLPP president being ruled out, the Rajapaksas are concerned about who the next President would be. If the JVP’s Anura Kumara Dissanayake is elected,  doomsday bells would start tolling for the Rajapaksas and the SLPP. In such a scenario the best bet is for the SLPP to back Wickremesinghe as the second best choice. However the cussedness of the Rajapaksas  and their penchant for “Karapincha”treatment stand in the way.",
        "The  Rajapaksa clan is  split over Ranil’s presidential prospects. Some are neutral, some are for Ranil and some are against Ranil. There is apprehension that if Ranil contests and wins the presidency,his hand would be strengthened politically.  The pro-Wickremesinghe alliance that elected him to office could contest Parliamentary elections and do well.  This would diminish the SLPP  and by extension the Rajapaksa clout.",
        "Therefore  Basil wanted Ranil to conduct the Parliament poll first. He gave out some sanctimonious reasons for the request. Ranil may have been too polite not to howl with laughter at the sight of Basil’s philosophy about  acquisition of too much power and its negative consequences.",
        "Basil’s calculation is that the SLPP could  win a bloc of  seats if a Parliament poll is held first. It could also compel many  SLPP  MPs who are pro-Wickremesinghe  to return to party folds. Above all , Wickremesinghe and his alliance are not likely  to fare  as well as  they would in a Presidential election.",
        "An early Parliamentary election could also reduce the JVP’s  seat tally.If Anura Kumara polls a huge amount of votes at the presidential hustings, that could result in the party doing similarly  well in the parliamentary poll. But if the Parliament elections are held first, the JVP could increase their MP tally but not to a very great extent.",
        "Sajith Premadasa and the SJB are likely to perform better in an early parliament election. The Tamil and Muslim parties as well as other MPs who  are likely to  cross over to Ranil if and when a Presidential election is announced would not do so. They would remain with Sajith. But if a presidential poll is held first, these parties are very likely to align with Ranil. Also many in the SJB will join Ranil if the presidential poll is held. They will hesitate to leave Sajith if a Parliamentary election is first.",
        "Thus  a Parliamentary election being held first would weaken Wickremesinghe considerably. He would no longer hold the whip hand as he contests the presidential election. Meanwhile the SLPP may be able  to strengthen their position by engineering break-aways and cross-overs from other parties. The SLPP could even sideline Wickremesinghe and finish him off politically. The party hierarchy has been helpleslly tolerating Ranil’s impudent independence and would love to bring him down notwithstanding the fact that he earned the SLPP a reprieve.  The Rajapaksa hallmark “Use and throw”can apply to Ranil too.",
        "Under these circumstances the SLPP’s master strategist Basil Rajapaksa  tried to coax, cajole or co-erce Ranil Wickremesinghe into  opting  for a Parliamentary election first. Despite all his endeavours ,there was nothing for  Basil  to crow about as foxy Ranil stayed put.",
        "Wickremesinghe’s  critics especially Tamil politicians and journalists often describe him as a man with “Narithanthiram”(foxy cunning). Ranil said he would consider an early Parliamentary election if 113 MPs sign a letter calling for dissolution of Parliament. Ranil knows that the majority of MPs don’t want an early Parliamentary election. If Basil tried to force  Pohottuwa MPs a large number would even split.  Hence Basil cannot get a majority of MPs to  demand an early poll.",
        "So Wickremesinghe  remained frm and did not fall victim to Basil’s wily stratagems. He would not conduct Parliamentary elections first. Ranil knows that the best thing for him is to conduct the Presidential election first because he has a very good chance of winning it. He will go ahead with the presidential poll despite the SLPP’s antics.",
        "Given Ranil Wickremesinghe’s firm stance, there is very little that Basil Rajapaks could do. The party itself is confused about its future course of action. Should the SLPP field a presidential candidate of its own or should it lend support  to Wickremesinghe’s candidacy? This is the party’s dilemma.  Furthermore there is a nagging fear. If the SLPP  succeeds in undermining Wickremesinghe out of spite , will that  enable Anura Kumara or Sajith to win? If that happens would not the Pohottuwa  now in the frying pan ,fall into the fire then?",
        "The responsibility of arriving at a decision  about fielding an SLPP presidential candidate has been given to party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is believed that the pragmatic Mahinda would reach a decision that would benefit his party  as well as Namal  his eldest son and political heir. Ultimately there can only be a Hobson’s choice for the SLPP. The Pohottuwa must find a way to support Ranil without appearing to do so.",

It has been read out by you. I just want to raise the point of order that it violates the powers of this House under Article 4 of the Constitution and we should appoint a select committee.",
        "I would like to say first and foremost the bill says, what is the national policy on gender equality and empowerment of women referred to in this bill. At the least it’s hard to find out. It’s not specific as there is no reference in the bill. There has been a national policy on women’s empowerment and gender equality since 2011. These are obligations of the Government under the Sustainable Development Goals 5 and a number of women’s conventions and agreements that we have signed.",
        "More than that, in the case of the Kamalawathi and other vs the Provincial Public Service Commission, SLR 1, the national policy was deemed within the domain of the Cabinet of Ministers and passed by the Supreme Court. It’s a parliament. It’s a political matter. The Supreme Court cannot in any way go and make any ruling on this. Then they are contravening and coming into our area.",
        "Secondly, there’s a large number of cases which have been given on the question of equality and equality of women. There are Ratnayaka Taranga, Lakmali versus Niroshan Abeykoon and the Inspector General of Police. It recognizes the dignity and well-being of people as a fundamental right. Then there are the ten-judge bench in Sarath Jayasinghe and others. We have the view that mere reliance on the text used in a constitution is not sufficient to ascertain the values that are embodied in a constitution or its amendments.",
        "Similarly, you have the case where Shirani Bandaranayake’s judgment in Karunathilaka and Jayalath de Silva and others, which says the basic principle governing the concept of equality is to remove unfairness and. It is profoundly forbidding action which denies equality and thereby discriminates.",
        "And finally, they have also ignored the special determination on the Penal Code Amendment, made by the Chief Justice. In this, we are talking of empowering women and ensuring equality for women. But according to the Goal 5 of Sustainable Development, even other minorities must get the government services without discrimination. That anyway follows from the average duties which have been given to us under fundamental rights.",
        "So all these powers have been disregarded. In a sense, the court has set aside everything and saying that this makes room. So in a way, what they have done is all these have disappeared, as if this court has eaten it up, all the other judgments. So in a way, they are practicing judicial cannibalism and we are being asked then to accept it, which this house can’t. How can you overrule a ten-judge bench and how can you overrule the Chief Justice? So that is one area. Then they are saying that this will allow same-sex marriages and gender this thing.",
        "No, it has nothing to do with it. We can’t allow that. They are going on this normal section which is put in every law by the legal draftsman and the AG, not by us. This law prevails over other laws, but this has also been interpreted. It’s finally for the court to decide. And I think in Chamara Sampath, not our Honorable Minister, but another person, and Neil Iddawela, they also referred to the points. This has been done by the doctrine of harmonious constructions. And the laws of marriage in this country can’t be changed by one section.",
        "More than that, they say that the whole of the, basically the whole Pirivena Education Act, can get knocked out by this. I don’t know on what basis they have done. We have Article 9 which protects Buddhism. And I know this Act because I have one of those who drafted it, and the Minister who implemented it. This has been defended by, this has been taken on by Article 9. And this, you think a small provision can change it? I don’t think the Supreme Court or the bench that sat, is even aware of what is Pariyatti, Patipatti, Pativeda.",
        "I think they should go to the temple and learn what this is. Or to a Peruvian before coming and telling this house, we are aware of what is happening there. We have honourable member of the Sangha also. So these rights of what he is saying is that all the rights of the Buddhists can be taken away by one small section. And what is going to happen? All the protection for Buddhism has been removed. And the power of this Supreme Court finally has to go back to the 1972 Constitution, all of us. Any inherent powers all must be, must be justified by the Constituent Assembly and the 72 Constitution which this is built.",
        "Therefore, when it comes, the Supreme Court can’t rule on a bill. They can only advise us on the value. It is basically a pre-legislative scrutiny. And what we did in the 78 Constitution as one of those involved in this house, was that there had been, we transferred the powers of the Constitutional Court to the Supreme Court to ensure independence of the court is even further strengthened. That’s all that we have done.",
        "But otherwise in 72, when the first instance came up and T.S. Fernando decided that the two weeks was not mandatory, the house overlooked it and ruled it out. I think honorable, the former President and Vasudeva Nanayakkara were members of the house. Because these powers of the Supreme Court in all other matters come under justice, but this comes under subordination. Certainly this comes from the Parliament. In a sense, unlike the other courts, the Supreme Court is transgender. So that is what they fall into. They get from two genders, both from us and under Article 4C and from us under Article 4A.",
        "So this is really a perverse determination which this house should not follow. And I am going to recommend that a select committee be appointed to go into it. There is no need to summon the judges. I don’t think we should go into that. There are enough that can be studied and they can recommend it. Because the majority of the members should be appointed by the Women’s Caucus. After all, this concerns women. But what happens is it deprives the majority of this population, the women, of their rights. And it takes away the safeguard of another majority, the Buddhists in the Constitution. So we cannot accept it. And this house then has to assert its own rights.",
        "Secondly, honourable speaker, there is a matter on which I have to make an announcement. You know, there has been a lot of discussion and heartburn about the burials and what took place during COVID-19. You know, I was also there. Initially, all countries sort of stopped burials. And then it went to the WHO. But in Sri Lanka, we appointed a committee. And unfortunately, that committee recommended that we don’t allow burial. While WHO took a different view. But then the Supreme Court also upheld the decision of the committee. So the government had to follow that. There was no choice at that stage. But now all this is over.",
        "And as we’ve gone through everything, this country any person should have the right to determine whether he is buried or cremated. He or she is buried, cremated, or given to the medical faculty. Therefore, the minister will bring a law which allows the right of burial, right of cremation, or gifting your body to the medical institutions. During this time, there was a lot of pain witnessed only mainly by the Muslims. But there are also Hindus, Buddhists, I know, and Christians who also like to be buried. So they were, we’d like to apologize to them on what has happened. And I hope this House will release, will support the bill that will be presented in the House.",
        "Thirdly, is that we are taking up the finance issues. And since I may not be here at that time, I just want to tell the House in regard to the rental income, we are going to have a wealth tax. And there will be a very high threshold. So 90 odd percent of the people’s houses will be exempt from this. So don’t worry, your house is safe. But why is it we are going to rental income? This was based on rating. Then we came up with a problem. Rates belong to the provincial council. So if you go on the rating list, there’s a possibility that the court can say that this money belongs to the provincial council. So we want to get it here. So we have used a different formula called rental income. Your income tax belongs to the central government. It’s the same.",
        "You generally have used the ratings. But to get over the constitutional issue that we have done this. But it’s going to have a very high threshold. And I don’t think the vast majority of the people in this country should even be worried about their house. So that’s all. But we will have to get on to wealth tax. I know SJB is very, very worried that the billionaires who are with them will get taxed. But nevertheless, this is the reason for it.",
        "The sovereignty of the people must be upheld, and this sovereignty resides with the Parliament and the President. Currently, both institutions are here. The Judiciary derives its power through the Parliament, a principle established in the 1971 election. In the Queen Vs Liyanage case, it was declared that these powers belong to the Supreme Court. This sparked significant debate, with the United National Party asserting that a 2/3 vote could change this, while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party disagreed. However, by 1970, the necessary 2/3 majority was obtained, and it was collectively agreed that this power originates from the constitution crafted by the Constituent Assembly, reflecting the people’s sovereignty, which remains unchanged.",
        "In the 1978 Constitution, we introduced a referendum amendment to further safeguard people’s sovereignty and bolster the judiciary’s independence. The court has not overstepped its powers; the laws of this country are passed by Parliament and cannot be contested. The court’s role is merely advisory on constitutional matters. We established a constitutional court, similar to systems in New Zealand and Finland, where a Parliamentary Select Committee determines the constitutionality of laws.",
        "Later in 1978, we decided that a separate court for this purpose was unnecessary and would only incur additional costs. Instead, we empowered the Supreme Court on behalf of Parliament. It is crucial to remember that the Cabinet cannot overturn a court’s decision. While various opinions and objections arose, a committee made a decision, which the court subsequently upheld. Blaming the government after such judicial confirmation is futile.",
        "I am not here to dwell on the past or to discuss previous controversies, such as those involving Minister Rishad Bathiudeen. Let’s leave those behind and focus on our current discussion, avoiding any form of extremism.”"

        "The IMF remains relentlessly opposed to the status quo and stability and is trying to de-dollarize and give a few unelected economic bureaucrats the power to destabilize the nation again.",
        "“Cambodia has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, outpacing many regional peers. Growth was driven by industrialization, increased foreign direct investment, and a surge in exports, particularly in labor-intensive manufacturing,:” the IMF said in its latest staff report on the country issued in January 2024.",
        "“The Cambodian economy is continuing its recovery from the pandemic, with a GDP growth of 5.2 percent in 2022, driven primarily by manufacturing exports, especially in garments and electronics. Tourism saw a continued rebound in 2023, reaching close to 80 percent of pre-pandemic tourist arrival levels by September 2023.”",

        "However, budget deficits are also around 3 to 4 percent. The debt to GDP ratio is 34 percent, a trend that is common in countries with currency boards or are dollarized where monetary policy is constrained. Currency unions with liquidity tools do not have the same benefit.",

        "Eventually Cambodia may return to its 1970s and 1980s fate or to the fate its unfortunate neighbor Laos, where domestic and IMF bureaucrats have full ‘monetary and fx policy’ discretion and is a basket case.",

        "Maldives also has low inflation around 1 to 3 percent without macro-economists to do complicated ‘monetary policy’.",
        "The Maldives Monetary Authority however does print money from time to time and get into trouble. When the peg breaks, inflation soars.",
        "Any technical assistance from the IMF to engage in more aggressive monetary policy would land the country in default.",
        "Maldives actually has borrowed too much, from China and also some of its Middle Eastern friends during about two decades of loose money starting from the Greenspan – Bernanke bubble when easy dollar borrowings were possible.",
        "What policy-makers and politicians have to understand is that denying monetary stability by various in-vogue third rate monetary regimes is not a foundation to base a policy framework.",
        "But from 1950 onwards that is what happened to this country.",
        "To be fair, current Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe is doing a good job.",
        "But the relaxation of standing facilities, which do not have a penal rate in Sri Lanka unlike in stable countries, is a key tool for banks to overtrade and goes against prudent policy. It could be the first step in the next default, as targeting call money rates in the middle of the corridor and narrowing the policy corridor was in the current default.",
        "However, the way to achieve stability is not to depend on personalities but to constrain discretionary policy by law.",
        "That is to either have a very low inflation target like 2 percent which has been mostly successful elsewhere, or a hard peg or currency competition through dollarization.",
        "All of these have worked. Where had a 7 percent inflation target worked? This country ran into a default without a war with the room given for open market operations and outright purchases with a 5 percent inflation target.",
        "This columnist is fully supportive of a 2 percent inflation target, but it is not as good as earlier anchors of the classical period or what is advocated by Austrian economists, which drove the policies of Germany after World War II, and made it a stable export powerhouse.",
        "It must be noted that the constant price level, which also denied private sector productivity growth to the poor, was advocated by the Chicago school, at a time when post-Keynesian policy was in full swing in the 1960s, with completely un-anchored policy, leading to the eventual collapse of the gold standard.",
        "Austrian economists warned that even a constant price level would also lead to a boom and bust scenario if there was a capitalist productivity boom, coming after a period of stability, which allows research and development.",
        "“The long-run tendency of the free market economy, unhampered by monetary expansion, is a gently falling price level, falling as the productivity and output of goods and services continually increase,” explained US economist Murray Rothbard in 1971 in the dying days of the Bretton Woods.",
        "“The Austrian policy of refraining at all times from monetary inflation would allow this tendency of the free market its head and thereby remove the disruptions of the business cycle.",
        "“The Chicago goal of a constant price level, which can be achieved only by a continual expansion of money and credit, would, as in the 1920s, unwittingly generate the cycle of boom and bust that has proved so destructive for the past two centuries.",
        "This was graphically demonstrated after Ben Bernanke misled Alan Greenspan to try and reverse private sector productivity growth from 2000, and kept rates near zero, firing an 8-year Fed cycle (also enabled by core-inflation which discounted commodity prices), leading to the housing bubble.",
        "In the Great Moderation (Volcker/Greenspan) period, gold prices fell to 800 to 484 dollars, free trade was accepted, East Asian poverty fell under fixed exchange rates and largely deflationary policy (reserve collections).",
        "In a reserve collecting peg forex troubles emerge before the asset bubble.",
        "The low US interest rates in the run up to 2008 bust as well as quantity easing that followed is one reason for bondholders and China to finance unstable countries with dollar credits. (Sri Lanka’s collapse in new sovereign default wave is not really China’s fault: Bellwether)",
        "In the wake of these monetary blunders not only is Sri Lanka in trouble, but also the US, showing how bad money leads to bad budgets once again."

        "“Following the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we’ve initiated numerous development projects in the Eastern Province, with several more slated to begin soon. The province, having endured the effects of a thirty-year-long war, faced developmental setbacks relative to other regions in the country.",
        "“As a result, I have been directed by the President to prioritize the development of the three districts within this province. Numerous projects are being devised and executed based on the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, aiming to establish the Eastern Province as the leading economic contributor among the country’s provinces.",
        "“We have acknowledged the significant development potential present in the Eastern Province. Notably, areas such as shrimp farming, mineral resources, ports, airports, water resources, tourism, agricultural modernization, and land development stand out as key sectors with promising prospects.",
        "“Furthermore, considering the abundant resources in the Eastern Province, it is crucial to manage them efficiently for developmental endeavours. I anticipate financial support from international financial institutions to aid in this effort. It is worth noting that the successful implementation of the development projects as directed by the President in the Eastern Province will suffice to address the nation’s debt crisis.",
        "“President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed attention to the salary concerns of the hill country communities, emphasizing the importance of fair wages for plantation workers. Negotiations are underway with estate companies regarding salary increments, which are typically reviewed every two years. The issue has been brought before the Wages Board, with input received from estate companies. Additionally, efforts are being made to link the plantation industry with foreign exchange, ensuring that salary adjustments align with the local cost of living in response to fluctuations in the dollar’s value.",
        "“It’s essential to acknowledge that, I believe President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only leader capable of leading our country out of the economic crisis. During his tenure, President Wickremesinghe secured support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), leading to our country’s swift restoration within a few months. I firmly believe that regardless of who holds the presidency in the future, the conditions set by the IMF cannot be altered. It’s evident from the experiences of countries that did not receive IMF support during their economic crises that they have struggled to recover fully.",
        "“Hence, as President Ranil Wickremesinghe stands as the only leader capable of rebuilding the country, it is essential to underscore that it is the obligation of all parties to lend their support to him.”"

        "Post-war issues the north-east wanted answers for, will not get trashed merely because 29% in N-E voted for NPP",
        "Plenty is written about the JVP-led NPP in 2024 September-November elections, with many comparisons and much praise. It is a historic achievement, no doubt. It was only possible with an amateur politician Gotabaya elected president by 6.9 million voters in 2019 November totally messing up everything possible. Politically naïve and meek too, he was a total contrast to what he was projected to be, a “Hitlerite” leader. The #GotaGoHome protest campaign brought to Galle Face Green turned into a violent protest in four weeks. Re-labelled as “Aragalaya” it wrecked the entirety of traditional party politics leaving the JVP/NPP to claim they fit in best to clean up the “system”.",
        "Within this historic win, the north-east poll is spoken of as the greatest achievement ever by a southern Sinhala political leadership. This is nevertheless not the first time the north-east voted overwhelmingly for a Sinhala presidential candidate. At the 2010 Presidential elections, over 60% of the north-east voted for General Sarath Fonseka, commander of the army when the war concluded in May 2009. He won all five north-east districts while NPP lost Batticaloa this election. But General Fonseka lost all districts in the Sinhala South. It was not a case of Tamil voter accepting Fonseka as their trusted candidate. It was a “vote of vengeance” against Rajapaksa.",
        "This 2024 too in north-east, it was a vote of vengeance. There is no denying the fact, a community wholly deprived of their decent and dignified life, a community ignored by their very political leaders, would at one point use the vote to tell the leaders they are no more worth the Tamil vote. It is a fact, the north-east Tamil people were left to themselves to agitate on their major issues, with especially the ITAK leadership firmly rooted in Colombo, supporting the Wickremesinghe government from 2015 January to end 2019. This anger in the Tamil community was brewing during the time the mothers and wives continued a 2,000-day Sathyagraha demanding information on enforced disappearances, with no established Tamil political leadership standing with them. In the north-east the war affected wanted land occupied by security forces, colonisation by Sinhala people, continuous surveillance of private and community life, total militarisation the LLRC wanted transformed into civil administration solved as priority issues with their local issues too. Almost three years ago on 7 December 2021 in the Daily Mirror article titled, “TNA should turn to People to come out of wilderness” I wrote, “Colombo centred politics of ITAK with more trust and faith in the UNP leadership gave space for smaller groups in North-East protests though without a clear perspective and with no practical programme for mass participation. Yet they fractured Tamil politics as clearly seen this 2020 August election. TNA was reduced to 10 from the 16 seats they won in 2015 with a reduced vote of 327,000 from over 516,000 previously. They lost 06 seats broken up between 04 Tamil groups. Sadly, ITAK learns nothing from their political beating, coming out after 05 years without even a draft copy of a Constitution in hand and electoral presence badly reduced.”",
        "Even after the harsh treatment at the 2020 August election, ITAK leadership did not get back to the “People”. They were more interested in factional fighting for ITAK leadership. How much was ITAK left thereafter in this 2024 September election? They ended with 257,813 votes and two seats less with only eight remaining. Which means to say, they have lost 50% of the votes they polled in 2015 and half the seats too. It was disenchantment, frustration and anger against ITAK that saw 11 independent groups and three new Tamil political parties contesting Jaffna this time. It was also the reason for 24.8% in Jaffna district and 20.4% in Vanni to vote for the party expected to form the next Government, the JVP/NPP.",
        "Why then did Batticaloa Tamils remain with ITAK? In Batticaloa, with Shanikiyan Rasamanickam representing ITAK, often standing with protesting and agitating people, appearing for people against police repression, ITAK wasn’t missing in Batticaloa. And I wrote in the article mentioned above, “What impact People could make with ‘collective effort’ should by now be known to young politician Rasamanickam, who marched all 05 days in the ‘P2P’ across East to North in early February (2021).” Batticaloa Tamil and Muslim people had little grouse to settle with ITAK and proved the vote polled by NPP in other districts in north and east were a “vote of vengeance” against their Tamil leaders.",
        "With 29% polled by the NPP, there are now 12 NPP MPs in north-east that include four Sinhala MPs from Digamadulla and two from Trincomalee. This cultural distinction cannot be simply forgotten, although NPP and Sinhala-Buddhists keep insisting there are no more ethno-religious divisions, as every citizen is a “Sri Lankan” and will be treated equally. There is nothing that can be identified as a “Sri Lankan culture” though, apart from Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim cultural identities. They remain Sri Lankan “Tamils” different to South Indian Tamils. They remain Sri Lankan “Muslims” different to Pakistani or Bangladeshi Muslims. There is no way in deleting their Tamil or Muslim cultural identities, by calling them “Sri Lankan”. Insisting on a “Sri Lankan” identity would impose the Sinhala-Buddhist identity as the majority identity, when cultural identities are artificially erased.",
        "That “dominance” is quite evident with no “ethno-religious equality” in day-to-day life. Sinhala-Buddhist dominance is quite conspicuous in how the “State” represents Sinhala-Buddhists in attending to civil issues. In how the ICCPR Act was used for just the opposite of what it was meant to be used for. In how an innocent Muslim village woman in Hasalaka was arrested by the police and remanded by the Magistrate for wearing a dress with a motif that was interpreted as the Buddhist “chakra”. In how Sinhala-Buddhist teachers, principals and provincial administrators treated their long time Muslim working colleagues immediately after the Easter Sunday tragedy. It is proved, the case against Dr. Shafi was totally fabricated, as he was a Muslim professional.",
        "Post-war issues the north-east wanted answers for, will not get trashed merely because 29% in N-E voted for NPP. Though President Anura Kumara presenting his Government’s policy statement at the inauguration of the first session of this new Parliament said, “Our nation has endured immense suffering due to ethnic conflicts. This soil has been soaked with enough blood, and rivers have flowed with the tears of countless people. Mistrust, suspicion, and anger among communities have grown to alarming levels” and pledged, “As representatives of this Parliament, our foremost responsibility is to ensure that our future generations inherit a nation free of such suffering. We owe it to them to create a state where such tragedies are not repeated”, he nor his party manifesto pledged to de-militarise and establish a neutral civil administration in N-E.",
        "Nor was there a promise to provide all information on enforced disappearances, the affected families kept demanding all these years. There was also no mention of Tamil land being colonised by Sinhala people, ignored in the NPP election manifesto. Absolutely no mention about archaeological sites being labelled as sacred Buddhist sites with State patronage, though in the policy statement President Anura Kumara pledges “I assure you with full responsibility that we will not allow a resurgence of divisive racist politics in our country. Similarly, no form of religious extremism will be permitted to take root.” (all quotes – https://www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk/ website)",
        "Taking all those promises as genuinely made, the 10 Crore Indian Rupee question that remains to be answered is, can New Delhi allow the NPP Government to go along with those statements, ignoring Pan-Tamil politics of Tamil Nadu? Will New Delhi forget the “Indo-Sri Lanka Accord” of 1987 and allow President Anura Kumara to continue without any mention about 13A and where they stand on it? Will ITAK and other Tamil political parties leave “devolution” to be decided as the NPP wants and will the NPP north-east MPs stay cold on PC elections?",
        "Will they sing along with the NPP “no divisive politics, only Sri Lankan”?",
        "Most importantly, what would the 29% north-east voters who elected NPP MPs, want from them? Do they want their occupied lands cleared? Do they want information about enforced disappearances? Do they want PC elections without further delay? Or, do they want jobs, promotions, building contracts, sand mining permits, appointments in corporation boards, consultancies, foreign service postings like their Sinhala brethren in the south? May be the 29% would stop with them.",
        "But the larger majority of the 71% who did not vote NPP, seems to want a political answer to their long-time grievances. They seem to exploit the quiet post-election social space to hype their political demands with “Maaveerar Naal” ceremonies brought to the open than any time before. In north-east it seems, people are not going home after casting their vote. How President AKD and his NPP Government would accommodate that Tamil politics, is what matters."

        "Colombo, March 6 (Daily Mirror) - The National People’s Power (NPP) said it would not derail the IMF programme if it won the presidency but would renegotiate its terms and conditions on implementations since the current austerity measures had burdened people and the attempts of the government to sell off public assets would bring severe economic consequences to the country.",
        "NPP economic council member Prof. Anil Jayantha said his party would also seek speedy actions on the debt restructuring process.",
        "Also, he said that a homegrown solution to stabilise the economy is needed and NPP is ready to come out with such plans of unleashing the growth potential, increasing government revenue, rebuilding foreign reserves and directing the economy for a sustainable growth.",
        "However, he said the present government could have gone for early negotiations with creditors in advance and explored other options available and adopted by other countries if it had a genuine intention of recovering the economy.",
        "He said the country is now halfway through the programme and therefore his party will not deviate from it as a pragmatic approach. Commenting more on the debts, he said the NPP would conduct an inquiry into certain credit agreements and how such borrowed funds were utilised."

        "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) in a letter to the Attorney General this week has stressed that it is imperative that an independent and impartial criminal investigation be launched into the alleged enforced disappearance of Gonapinuwala Kapila Kumara De Silva, a resident of Horowpathana, Anuradhapura in March 2024.",
        "The HRCSL urged the Attorney General to review the evidence and allegations and decide whether a separate criminal inquiry should be initiated by the Sri Lanka Police under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, based on the Attorney General’s counsel.",
        "The HRCSL observed that De Silva was reported missing on 27 March 2024. According to De Silva’s account, he was allegedly abducted by a group in civilian attire in a white van who identified themselves as law enforcement officers.",
        "“He alleged that the persons who took him into custody interrogated him for several days in relation to a shooting incident. He alleged that his interrogators assaulted him and that, on one occasion, informed him that he would be executed. He claimed that he had informed the interrogators that he was not involved in the said incident,” the HRCSL said.",
        "The HRCSL reported that it had contacted the Special Task Force (STF) to ascertain if De Silva was in their custody, as his family suspected. It said however, the STF denied having arrested him and said that De Silva was a suspect in a shooting incident and was wanted by the STF, but he was currently evading capture.",
        "The HRCSL said it found on 22 April that De Silva was in the custody of the Pitigala Police and had been presented to court before being remanded. According to the victim, the HRCSL said he was handed over to the Pitigala Police on 20 April by those who abducted him.",
        "The HRCSL told the Attorney General it is of the view that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the key elements of the offence of ‘enforced disappearance’ according to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act may have been satisfied in De Silva’s case.",
        "“The HRCSL accordingly urges you to consider providing the requisite advice to Sri Lanka Police to initiate such a criminal investigation into the possible enforced disappearance of de Silva. We also urge you to consider, if applicable, the initiation of proceedings before the High Court under and in terms of the Act,” it said."

        "The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants began early Wednesday as a region on edge wondered whether it will hold.",
        "The ceasefire announced Tuesday is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.",
        "There were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce, and there were signs of celebration in Beirut. But Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the agreement.",
        "The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance.",
        "An Israeli military spokesman, in an Arabic-language X post in the first half-hour of the ceasefire, warned evacuated residents of southern Lebanon to not head home yet, saying the military remained deployed there.",
        "The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities.",
        "The ceasefire does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable.",
        "There appeared to be lingering disagreement over whether Israel would have the right to strike Hezbollah if it believed the militants had violated the agreement, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted was part of the deal but which Lebanese and Hezbollah officials have rejected.",
        "Israel’s security Cabinet approved the U.S.-France-brokered ceasefire agreement after Netanyahu presented it, his office said. U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington, called the agreement “good news” and said his administration would make a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
        "The Biden administration spent much of this year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza but the talks repeatedly sputtered to a halt. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East without saying how.",
        "Netanyahu presented the ceasefire proposal to Cabinet ministers after a televised address in which he listed accomplishments against Israel’s enemies across the region. He said a ceasefire with Hezbollah would further isolate Hamas in Gaza and allow Israel to focus on its main enemy, Iran.",
        "“If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack,” he said. “For every violation, we will attack with might.”",
        "Biden said Israel reserved the right to quickly resume operations in Lebanon if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the truce, but that the deal “was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.”",
        "Netanyahu’s office said Israel appreciated the U.S. efforts in securing the deal but “reserves the right to act against every threat to its security.”",
        "Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire and described it as a crucial step toward stability and the return of displaced people.",
        "Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday it had not seen the agreement in its final form.",
        "“After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,” Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah’s political council, told the Al Jazeera news network.",
        "“We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state,” he said, referring to Israel’s demand for freedom of action. “Any violation of sovereignty is refused.”",
        "Even as ceasefire efforts gained momentum in recent days, Israel continued to strike what it called Hezbollah targets across Lebanon while the militants fired rockets, missiles and drones across the border.",
        "An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in central Beirut — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.",
        "Israel also struck a building in Beirut’s bustling commercial district of Hamra for the first time, hitting a site around 400 meters (yards) from Lebanon’s Central Bank. There were no reports of casualties.",
        "The Israeli military said it struck targets linked to Hezbollah’s financial arm.",
        "The evacuation warnings covered many areas, including parts of Beirut that previously were not targeted. Residents fled. Traffic was gridlocked, with mattresses tied to some cars. Dozens of people, some wearing pajamas, gathered in a central square, huddling under blankets or standing around fires as Israeli drones buzzed overhead.",
        "Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a major presence, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where the U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, is headquartered.",
        "The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border.",
        "Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",
        "Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have exchanged barrages ever since.",
        "Israel escalated its bombardment in mid-September and later sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire so tens of thousands of evacuated Israelis could return to their homes.",
        "More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members.",
        "Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate in the country’s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive in Lebanon."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "When the Britishers introduced tea as an export crop to old Ceylon in mid 19th century, it was a game changer. It transformed the traditional subsistence agricultural economy that prevailed to a modern plantation economy seeking to satisfy the demand for the new beverage called tea spreading like a pandemic across Europe and Americas. Initially, it was a beverage of the rich and the aristocrats. A pound of tea was sold, according to advertisements that were inserted in papers, for 25 Sterling Pounds. This exclusive product was made inclusive by ingenious marketing strategies adopted by tea traders like presenting it as a brain tonic.",
        "But when the demand went up, the production too should be stepped up. Since Sri Lanka’s local population was unwilling to work in plantations, the planters had to bring in indentured labour from South India. These men and women who spoke Tamil were a stateless lot not belonging either to India or to Sri Lanka. They were confined to residences known as ‘lines’ where in a room of about 10 feet by 15 feet, about five or six members of a family were packed like sardines in a can. Sri Lanka’s villagers were also poor but these Tamil labourers in plantations were poorer with no facilities for education or social mobility. By any standard, they were in abject poverty.",
        "One of the distinguishing features of Homo sapiens is that they are inclined to artistic expressions no matter whether they live in a cave or in a modern city. Likewise, these Tamil labourers in Sri Lanka’s plantations have taken time to pen poems in Tamil to express their feelings of day-to-day hardships or aesthetic cum religious wishes. These creative works would have gone unnoticed by the rest of us in society if not for the Sri Lanka branch of PEN International, an outfit for writers to express their views without fear or favour.",
        "PEN International which has existed since 1921 says that the objective of its advocacy is for writers to express their views: “Every day, countless writers are detained, harassed, persecuted, or even killed for the practice of their profession. We will not let their voices be silenced. We raise awareness of their cases, campaign against abuses and lobby governments for their release.”",
        "But the present book released by PEN Sri Lanka by laboriously translating the pieces of poetry, originally in Tamil, by these workers into English and Sinhala is a promotional work aiming at building a cultural bond between them and the rest of us in contemporary Sri Lankan society. The book is titled ‘Tea-Stained Lines’ referring to the line rooms in which they are living and, because of their work involving the cultivation, plucking, and manufacturing tea, their bodies and living quarters are also stained by its strong liquors. The mind soothing aroma of fresh tea that you smell when you pass by a tea factory can also be whiffed from the bodies of these social outcasts in Sri Lanka.",
        "It is an anthology of hill-country Tamil poems with translations into English and Sinhala. It is a creditable work and for the first time, Sinhala and English readers could understand that there are in those hills cramped into line rooms, people who are like them with feelings and ability to express those feelings using poetic means.",
        "The anthology opens with a tribute to one of the leading up-country Tamil poets, C.V. Velupillai who has penned a poem about the drudgery of the tea pluckers from morning to night for seven days a week and for 365 days a year. Titled Tea Pluckers, he has presented to us in poetic language how their bronze bodies move from early in the morning to night from valley to valley among the tea bushes carrying various implements used for weeding, fertilising, pruning, and tending to the tea bushes. He ends the poem: “Eight hours in a day, Seven times in a week, Thus their life blood flows, To fashion this land, A paradise for some”.",
        "So, the tea that we drink enjoying the aroma, tasting the distinguished liquor, and stimulating the dormant senses comes from the sweat and blood of these people who are basically anonymous and unknown. But that is the nature of our perceptions. We see only what can be seen within our eyesight and not beyond. And we do not care. Velupillai has brought this stark reality to us pricking our hearts to a sudden awakening.",
        "That is not all. There are 20 more such pieces of poetry. The anthology reveals the addresses and contact numbers of poets but not their background. Therefore, we do not know under what circumstance and difficulties they have chosen the language of poetry to reveal their innermost feelings. But that is not an impediment for readers to appreciate the poems and enjoy them.",
        "All these poems are extremely creative works in my view. But due to space limitations, I will analyse only a few important ones. Readers are advised to have access to this volume and enjoy all the poems which have been penned by a people who have been suffering immensely in their day-to-day life ever since they had landed in this amicable island.",
        "Malliyappusandhi Thilakar, one of the editors of the volume, has written a long poem appealing to various female divinities in Hindu religion to descend at least once to resolve the grave problems faced by innocent up-country Tamils. The plea has gone in general to Divine Mother and more specifically to Ambiga, Dhurgha, Kali, Shakthi, Maary or Mary, and Parashakthi, leading feminine divinities in Hindu religion. A separate issue faced by contemporary up-country Tamils is brought to the notice of each of these divinities. Divine Mother is coaxed to appear at least once to satisfy the innocent people yearning her presence with hope. Ambiga to provide nothing for these people but thatching sheets to cover her temple roof, Dhurgha to provide some cement to build the steps to the temple, Kali to see the temple festivities financed out of the meagre donations made by them in her name, Shakthi to take the sufferings out of them, Maary to protect them, and Parashakthi to provide them with land.",
        "He ends the poem by announcing that it would be frustrating to tell them that you would not come. Hence, the appeal is to come at least once and help these innocent people. Thilakar’s message here is very clear. In every society the innocent people who have no other hope except the intervention of the divinities are being exploited by smart people by promising various boons which are never delivered. Hence, it is appropriate if these divinities appear in this world at least once to tell them the truth.",
        "Su Thavachelvam’s piece titled ‘That Day Is Not Far Off’ is an attempt at bringing to our notice the sufferings of these people working in these plantations when we, who might fight for their rights, do so without a true feeling about them. He asks aloud: “Do you know the speed of the pulse in my people?” and “Can you feel the amplitude of their emotions?” and “Does your rusted brain know the vision they behold about these mountains?” As I have personally experienced, the life they live in those line rooms, derogatorily called ‘Laima’ in Sinhala, has been the worst of the human experiences. No one should be condemned to have this life. Therefore, Thavachelvam asks as: “Have you seen how they live suffocated by the smell of the urine that comes from the end of the Laima?” That is only a modest description. The pit latrines are emitting an odour that cannot be borne by even an animal let alone a human. That is why many take alcohol or smote beedis before they go to the toilet. Over time, they get addicted to this sinful practice.",
        "S.P. Balamurugan has drawn our attention to the agony of the statelessness of these up-country Tamils. In his poem titled ‘Uncopied Documents’, he has said that all those living in line rooms in plantations in the up-country are without proper identity documents or documents relating to their origin. Hence, he says: “No records of our existence linger here, no will there be in the future, so let’s breathe life now, into our dreams”. So, when a man is destitute and helpless, there is no other way to seek solation except dreaming. That is because as Balamurugan says the next step without proper papers is a mystery. Hence, he resolves: “Let’s uncover our own identity, and innovate true documents”. This statelessness is a perennial problem faced by up-country Tamils since they were disfranchised in 1950 by the Sinhalese led government of D.S. Senanayake. Since then, neither their leaders nor successive governments have made any attempt at finding a solution.",
        "According to Nalliah Chandrasegaran, up-country Tamils have been betrayed not only by the hostile society but by their own unions. In a piece of poetry titled ‘Collective Agreement’, he has said boldly that “To this land and to tea, we are bound by blood. We who know no joy but pain, our kin, robbed of contentment, were betrayed by the Unions.” The irony is that these Tamil workers are suffering to the hilt and need sympathetic and empathetic attention of unions. Yet, the unions use them as stooges to gain their happy living and the workers raise flags and cry out slogans hailing unions and condemning unseen enemies just for a packet of rice that costs only Rs. 100. On the other side of the coin, these poor Tamils must pay bribes to get identity cards or birth certificates. Yet nothing has been delivered and they remain squandered.",
        "He boldly states: “Will the breeze of freedom ever bring us happiness? Even, once, in heaven? Or will a collective agreement barricade our path, even then?” This is a serious indictment against unions which proclaim to be their saviours. Then, how to save you from the saviour is the biggest issue that you have. The collective agreements have blocked their move forward. The question openly raised here is that those collective agreements which unions sign with employers will block their salvation even after death. This is a good representation of the polarisation of members from union leaders. It is an instance where the enemy comes from within rather than from outside. The fearless poet has raised that issue.",
        "S. Rathnajothi has raised another aspect of the suffering of these Tamils. Wearing a sarong and a banian and walking bare foot, they seem to be ordinary mortals to outsiders. But they are extraordinary in their behaviour and practices. How? Explains Rathnajothi from the point of a son: “How many days were you in hunger, taking comfort in the sight of your children feeding? No slippers for your feet, yet to provide us with shoes, you carried our weight, worried our feet might get soiled.” It is only an extraordinary man who could endure such pain. So, the wish of the son is to become a son of this extraordinary man throughout this Samsara, the cycle of birth and rebirth which is a part of the belief system in Hindu religion.",
        "Because of the space limitation, I have presented only a few of the poems in detail here. But there are others in this anthology whose work by no means is less important. The editors have very carefully selected the poems, edited them suitably, and then translated into English and Sinhala for those outside this community to enjoy. Therefore, the work done by PEN Sri Lanka is creditable. In this literary month in which books are adored by many, I recommend to all readers, Tamil, English, and Sinhala, to have a copy of this anthology and enjoy.",

        "In a joint statement, the six allied nations said the strikes specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis’ missile and air surveillance capabilities.",
        "They added, “Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.”",
        "Britain’s Ministry of Defense confirmed that four Royal Air Force Typhoon jets struck “multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield” with precision-guided bombs.",
        "The strikes, said Defense Secretary Grant Shapps, were “aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities” and would “deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade.”",
        "One senior U.S. military official told reporters the strikes dropped between 25 and 30 munitions and hit multiple targets in each location, adding that the U.S. “observed good impacts and effects” at all sites, including the destruction of more advanced weapons in the underground storage facility. The official said this is the first time such advanced weapons were targeted.",
        "The official also said fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier conducted strikes, and other ships involved included the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both naval destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser.",
        "The joint operation comes about 10 days after U.S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60 targets in 28 locations.",
        "That was the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.",
        "The Houthis’ media office said in an online statement Monday that raids targeted Sanaa, Yemen’s capital. And Jamal Hassan, a resident from south Sanaa, told The Associated Press that two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street.",
        "An Associated Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday.",
        "Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said there were raids on three areas of Sanaa: al-Dailami Air Base just north of the capital, Sarif, northeast of the city center, and al-Hafa, which is south of Sanaa.",

        "The latest barrage of allied attacks marks the eighth time the U.S. has conducted strikes on Houthi sites since Jan. 12. And it follows an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U.S. fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over the past week.",
        "The rapid response missions, which officials said go after launchers that are armed and ready to fire, demonstrate the military’s increasing ability to watch, detect and strike militant activities in Yemen.",
        "The chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes haven’t deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U.S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality.",
        "For months, the Houthis have attacked ships in the region’s waterways that they say are either linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports.",
        "They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel.",
        "But any such links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue.",
        "The U.S. and allies warned of retaliation for weeks, and the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning on Jan. 3 to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action.",
        "That threat, however, had little noticeable effect. The Houthis continued to attack ships in the region, including at times appearing to target U.S. Navy and U.S.-owned ships, in addition to the wide range of commercial vessels.",
        "Of the eight strike missions on Yemen this month, all but the two with Britain were conducted by the U.S. military alone. Five of the latest strikes were labeled self-defense to take out missiles ready to fire.",
        "The most recent, on Saturday, struck and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch, according to Central Command.",
        "The Biden administration has also put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing, while also allowing vital humanitarian aid to continue flowing to impoverished Yemenis.",
        "U.S. defense officials have said they believe the strikes have degraded the Houthis’ weapons and strike capabilities. But Biden and others have acknowledged that the rebels are well-equipped by Iran and are likely to continue the attacks.",
        "The Houthis, meanwhile, have made it clear that they have no intention of scaling back their assault.",
        "In the wake of the first U.S. and British joint attack, Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their Foreign Ministry, said, “America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression.”",
        "The continued harassment of the ships has driven the U.S. and international partners to take extraordinary steps to defend them through a joint mission named Operation Prosperity Guardian, in which they provide a protective umbrella for vessels traveling the critical waterway that runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.",
        "About 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time. And the ongoing violence has prompted companies to reroute their ships, sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope instead — a much longer and less efficient passage."

        "ECONOMYNEXT – Pilots of a SriLankan Airlines flight from Sydney to Colombo were involved in a tense verbal altercation, with one of them being locked out of the cockpit of an Airbus A330, aviation sources said.",
        "A senior cabin crew member intervened to defuse the situation and ensure that the copilot could return to the cockpit.",
        "Sri Lankan airlines in a statement on Monday confirmed an incident on UL607, and said the captain has since been grounded.",
        "Flight UL607 took off without incident until the female First Officer requested a toilet break. Standard safety procedures require another member of the cabin crew, usually the purser, to enter the cockpit to accompany the pilot flying at the time.",
        "While the First Officer waiting to enter toilet and before a cabin crew member had entered the cockpit, the captain had closed the door and allegedly refused to reopen it.",
        "Words were exchanged via the communication link between the cockpit and outside, and it reportedly took considerable effort from a senior crew member to persuade the captain to end the standoff, according to a source familiar with the case.",
        "After the flight landed safely in Colombo, the First Officer lodged a complaint, which has now been referred to the Civil Aviation Authority, the aviation regulator.",
        "“SriLankan Airlines confirms that an investigation is currently underway in accordance with civil aviation regulations regarding the incident on flight UL 607 from Sydney to Colombo today (14 October),” the airline said.",
        "It was “fully cooperating with the relevant authorities, and the captain has been grounded pending the outcome of the investigation.”",
        "The national carrier stressed that safety and compliance with all regulatory requirements remained Sri Lankan Airlines’ top priority. (COLOMBO/October 14/2024)"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The big news on the presidential election front – if it could be so termed – last week was Namal Rajapaksa being anointed as the  pohottuwa’s presidential candidate. The SLPP has long been playing a cat and mouse game, loudly declaring that they will be fielding a candidate but remaining remarkably shy of naming that worthy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s foot dragging about declaring himself a runner, while launching his campaign and getting proxies to proclaim his candidacy, was perceived by many as a waiting game to see whether the Rajapaksas were eventually going to go along with him for five more years. The answer, preceded by Basil Rajapaksa’s “bayath nehe, nayath nehe” (we’re neither afraid nor are we in debt) statement, came last Wednesday with Namal throwing himself at his father’s and uncle’s feet and accepting the party nomination.",
        "It has only been a little over two years since Gotabaya Rajapaksa called for the resignation of his prime minister brother and his government and fled the country to quit himself from Singapore. But in this short span of time when the Rajapaksas and their fellow travelers did not know where to hide, they have recovered sufficiently to field one of their own for the presidency. The country has, of course, been treated to the spectacle of politicians, despised in the months leading to the aragalaya, deserting MR and hitching their wagon to the Wickremesinghe star. Gone are the days when they fondly called Mahinda Rajapaksa appachchi though many yet maintain that they remain SLPP members although they are opposing that party’s nominee at the upcoming presidential election.",
        "A political cartoon published last Friday showed Mahinda Rajapaksa draping a too long satakaya round Namal’s shoulder while Dhammika Perera was shown hanging up his blue suit and red tie. It wasn’t very long ago when MR told reporters that there was “more time for Namal.” Dhammika Perera, who had for the last several weeks been stating his availability and promoting his DP Education on national television wrote to the SLPP Secretary saying he was pulling out for a “personal reason” but did not disclose what it was. He succeeded Basil Rajapaksa as an SLPP National List MP having shed his corporate connections, briefly served as Minister of Investment Promotion during the tail end of the GR presidency and has barely spoken a word in parliament since his entry to the legislature. Whether his withdrawal from the race was on his own volition or a command performance, we do not know.",
        "There is little doubt that most of the political alliances now been forged and individual stances being adopted are mostly related to the parliamentary election due in August next year. Of course whoever wins the September 21 contest can instantly dissolve parliament if he so wishes. Basil Rajapaksa tried hard, though unsuccessfully, to persuade President RW to have a parliamentary election ahead of the presidential poll. This was totally on account of the calculation that the SLPP would do better under such an arrangement. It is commonsense if not common knowledge that the vaasi paththata hoiya (hurrah for the winning side) syndrome works well in this country and the winning president will want to exploit this factor. Already the JVP/NPP has said they would do that. Other parties may be influenced by the five years of parliamentary service rule to qualify for a pension. Many incumbents have not completed this period.",
        "There has been speculation that the number of runners at the forthcoming election may be a record. Up to Thursday a total of 24 candidates from recognized political parties and independents have posted deposits to contest. This compares to 19 candidates in 2015 and 35 in 2019. As we pointed out in this space recently the vast majority of these contestants don’t have a snowball’s chance in the sun. Proxies are often fielded by serious runners to take over candidate benefits. Others run as vote breakers, some to mark a presence and some out of sheer lunacy. But the length of the ballot paper comes at a heavy cost to the taxpayer. An obvious deterrent to frivolous candidature would to set the required deposit at a higher level than what prevails today. A cabinet decision to this effect was taken earlier this year but it was too late for the forthcoming election. Both the election and political authorities have been remiss over this matter.",
        "As matters stand at present, the serious contenders would be Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, President Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and perhaps Namal Rajapaksa. Opinion polling in this country has seldom been accurate with samples taken not representing a realistic cross section of the population. At this stage the pundit can say that Royal will win the match, or S. Thomas’ will win or it’ll be a draw. The situation, of course, could change as September 21 approaches. There will be massive (and wasteful) expenditure with little transparency on source of funds, walls defaced by posters and loudspeakers bellowing political rhetoric. It is to be hoped that law and order will be maintained even without an IGP. The present status quo is preferable to a partisan on the hot seat.",

        "Najmul hit 122 not out off 129 balls, and was ably supported by one of his predecessors as captain, Mushfiqur Rahim, who was unbeaten on 73, as Bangladesh raced to 257-4 in 44.4 overs after bowling out Sri Lanka for 255 runs.",

        "The creations of Mary Shelley and Lord Balfour; the former being fiction and the latter being played out in 4K ultra-HD resolution today, are separated by time and space, but offer lessons for the enquiring mind.",
        "The vote taken on 29th November 1947 to create the state of Israel, was rejected by all Arab States. On 30th November, the very next day, the first phase of the Arab-Israeli war began and ended with thousands dead and the forcible expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.",
        "World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.",
        "Many, many years of continued war, with millions of lives lost, were only interrupted by phony moral handwringing. Crocodile tears were on full display, while the invasion of a neighbouring country and the well-documented slaughter at Sabra and Shatila were allowed to continue. The slow but deliberate carving out of additional ‘occupied land’ in the name of buffer zones were – even though illegal – for all practical purposes, sanctioned. Those who colluded to create the state of Israel, continued to wear blinkers.",
        "Maybe it is post hoc rationalisation. But Lord Arthur Balfour words ‘… it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine…’, ring hollow and deliberately disingenuous – a flimsy sugarcoat on the bitter and deadly pill concocted to rid a nation of people from their birthright.",
        "Today, however, it is no longer possible to shroud the many atrocities. Maybe, it is the pure power of social media, or maybe King Jr. had been right all along. ‘The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.’",
        "For whatever happy conflation of circumstances, those who schemed to implement the 1917 Balfour Declaration, are today squirming publicly at the brutality and barbarity that continue to besiege that battered population of Palestine.",
        "Frankenstein: a work of fiction is the result of a wager between friends and has captured the imagination of generations since its publication in 1818.",
        "In Mary Shelley’s fictitious narrative, Victor Frankenstein (Frankenstein is the name of the scientist and not of his creation) crafted the creature to assess and demonstrate his scientific ability. But very soon Victor understood the very basic nature of his own creation and is forced to watch helplessly as all he holds dear is slaughtered and killed.",
        "“Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; …” Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley’s, Frankenstein",
        "It is the subsequent tribulations of Victor, trying to exert control over his own creation and ultimately failing in the attempt, that infuses the story with such timeless fascination on a canvass of universal moral tenets.",
        "Yet, times have changed. Western powers are no longer able to hide and deny the daily brutality. The parlour tricks that took the sting out of the Sabra and Shatila massacres are no longer tenable in the age of Tik Tok. {Aside} Attempting to ban Tik Tok will not, no longer be able to bottle the genie.",
        "Just like Victor Frankenstein, world leaders are learning that they are no longer in control. Blinken’s not-so friendly words, Chancellor Scholz’s outright warning; even while standing next to the Israeli PM, even a Security Council’s resolution, no longer seem to have the capability to restrain. Biden can no longer pretend to portray Netanyahu as his boo.",
        "Unable to control his creation, Victor ultimately dies a miserable death while the creature escapes. Whether it keeps its ‘stated’ intention to stop the killings, or continues on its merry path, Mary Shelley declines to offer nary a clue.",
        "Historian and Army General Thucydides wrote in the 5th Century BC that, ‘… when we are talking about the human plane, questions of justice only arise when there is power to compel….’. I pray that the Guardians of the Moral Universe, those who have the power to compel will, at least attempt, to match the moral conviction of Victor Frankenstein.",

        "ECONOMYNEXT – The number of Israeli tourists to Sri Lanka had declined, while tourist arrivals in general had risen in October, Minister Vijitha Herath said.",
        "“There was a drop in their [Israeli] arrivals. That is true,” cabinet spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters on Wednesday (06).",
        "“As of yesterday, there were 151 Israelis reported to be in the country,” Herath said.",
        "21,913 Israelis visited the country in the month of October.",
        "On October 23, the US Embassy in Sri Lanka asked nationals to avoid Arugam Bay, a popular tourist destination, in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Coast saying there was credible information of an attack.",
        "The area had seen an influx of Israeli visitors of late. In the past few months, Israelis have been seen residing in the predominately Muslim area, opening bars and other businesses.",
        "Israel has asked citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Sri Lanka, leave coastal tourist areas including Arugam Bay and stop overt displays of Hebrew language in clothes or other signs that could lead to identification.",
        "Herath was responding to a reporter’s question on the impact on tourism from the travel warnings and following the Vistara airline bomb scare.",
        "“Overall, there was an increase in tourist arrivals in October.”",
        "The Vistara flight UK 131 (A320 Neo) from Mumbai to Colombo had received a hoax call on bomb threats on October 19.",
        "The Sri Lanka government had increased security measures to ensure tourists would not feel uncomfortable, Herath said.",
        "He said people who spread false information would be punished accordingly. (Colombo/Nov7/2024)"

        "“Oh little monk, it is an arduous path you are taking…” on Martin Luther’s decision to challenge the papacy.",
        "“The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like an incubus upon the brain of the living”",
        "As the common saying goes ‘Success has many fathers but failure is an orphan’. And, in recent times, no other political career has been as successful as that of President Anura Kumar Dissanayake.",
        "Hailing from rural Thambuttegama, with no pretension to so called Sri Lankan elite status, member of a putatively Marxist political party (an ideology seemingly out of step with the modern world in many aspects) and having received only about 3% of the general vote at the Presidential elections in 2019, Dissanayake yet won an emphatic approval from the voter in September 2024. His closest rival was more than a million votes behind. Prominent politicians, heralded for decades, would have turned green with envy contemplating the Dissanayake success.",
        "Dissanayake’s ascendency was evident even before the election results were known, prompting rivals and adversaries to snipe at him directly as well as indirectly. The then incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe was moved to observe with his customary condescension that Dissanayake is proof of his contribution to the development of the country. Wickremesinghe claimed that when he was Education Minister he had developed schools in Thambuttegama where Anura Dissanayake had his primary education.",
        "He then went on to say that the Kelaniya University from which Anura Dissanayake later graduated was a result of the efforts of his uncle J.R. Jayewardene, a former President.",
        "Not to be left out, Chandrika Bandaranaike, another ex-President, whose two terms in power (1994-2005) are commonly referred to as the lost years, opined that non-English speaking boys from the villages can aspire for high political office today, only because of the policies implemented by her father S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956.",
        "Not only Anura Dissanayake, the entire nation should feel trapped by this glutinous munificence, apparently the average Sri Lankan cannot move an inch without being an abject beneficiary of the wisdom and the skill of his elite leaders. And these are politicians who had humbly canvassed the voters at various elections, and, have left a hopelessly indebted country today. As these individuals had held various Cabinet positions at some point, anything done by their Ministries at the time have become personal acts of philanthropy, deserving of the people’s eternal gratitude.",
        "Unless the money for the project came from an individual endowment, in mature democracies no leader would so tastelessly claim ownership for such government initiatives. Any government initiative is the result of policies long in gestation, sculptured by many and implemented by several departments carrying thousands of employees, and most importantly, funded with public money or foreign aid.",
        "It is ridiculous to claim any initiative, whether it be the enactment of a law or the making of an institution (Presidential system, Kelaniya University or the Youth Council) as a completely original creations of a Sri Lankan politician. These things have existed for decades, if not centuries, in other countries, from whom we borrow ideas.",
        "To say that there would be no Anura Dissanayake if not for S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, no Kelaniya University had there been no J.R. Jayewardene, or no schools in Tambuttegama if Ranil Wickremesinghe had not smiled benevolently, is nonsensical. History evolves regardless of any individual: perhaps, if there was a better representative of the native expectations in 1956 than S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, this country would not be in the muddle it is today. Maybe, if the Kelaniya University was conceived by a more evolved personality, it would now figure among the ranked universities of Asia. Similarly, if the schools in Tambuttegama were developed by a genuine and competent minister, that area would have become a hub of learning.",
        "When self-promoting politicians claim authorship of events, they must realise that an alternate history was also possible. In view of the utter failure of all systems/institutions in this country, that alternate history maybe what this nation tragically missed. If post-independence political power had not been monopolised by a few families and old boys of one or two schools, the story of this nation of 20 odd million could have been very different. Only these few schools or families hold the secret to leadership skills or there is an ingrained disease in the body politic of the country. Not only has their performance been a palpable flop, by their self-serving narration of the history and the twisted interpretation of democratic values, these elite have distorted an entire era.",
        "S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, as shown by his numerous essays and speeches had been a man of broad culture and eclectic interests. From the highest ranks of the native hierarchy created by the colonial power, he was well placed to benefit from a liberal British education including a stint at Oxford. Going overseas was extremely rare for Ceylonese then, going to England, the power centre of the world, was a dream come true. Naturally, both in thought and manner, he reflected an acute engagement with British culture, attracted by many aspects and repulsed by some. Of a loquacious nature, SWRD was fascinated by the Oxford Union and its debates, taking great pride in becoming its secretary.",
        "“Although at the Union I never seem to catch the eye of the President, I knew that I could make a better speech than most of those who were given preference over me. I knew I could write better Greek prose than many of the scholars with their long rustling gowns, looking superciliously at the ‘darkie’ who had the temerity to read for the honour School of Classics”",
        "Bandaranaike returned to his motherland in 1925. At the Kalagedihena junction, three miles distant from Sir Solomon’s country seat, the party was met by the inhabitants of the Pattu, and Dias Bandaranaike was garlanded. A procession was then formed, headed by a number of caparisoned elephants and attended by dancers and music.",
        "The young Bandaranaike replied the excited crowd, “Thank you very much for the kind address with which you have presented me. The first thing I must do is to apologise to you for speaking to you in English. Owing to my long absence from my country, I am not sufficiently fluent in Sinhalese to be able to address you in Sinhalese at length.”",
        "S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike had been in England for four long years (1921-25)!",
        "Singapore’s remarkable rise, and the pivotal role of Lee Kuan Yew in the rapid transformation of what was a shanty town to one of the richest, most efficient, and respected countries in the world, needs no elaboration. Himself a British graduate of the late 1940s, Lee Kuan Yew wrote extensively on global issues. His observations of the SWRD premiership of Ceylon 1956-59: “My first visit to Sri Lanka was in 1956. I stayed at the Galle Face Hotel, their premier British era hotel by the sea. I was impressed by the public buildings, because Mountbatten had based his Southeast Asia command in Kandy, Ceylon had more resources and better infrastructure than Singapore.",
        "That same year, SWRD became the Prime Minister. Singapore’s then chief minister Lim Yew Hock, invited me to meet him at dinner. A dapper little man, well-dressed and articulate…he spoke as if he was still in the Oxford Union debating society. He was a brown ‘pukka sahib’; English educated and born a Christian; he had decided on nativism and converted to Buddhism, and had become a champion of the Sinhalese language. It was the start of the unravelling of Ceylon.”",
        "Was SWRD a genuine champion of what he professed, or a fake adventurer taking advantage of the social backwardness of his country?",
        "Although anglicised as nearly all native elite then were, J.R. Jayewardene by education and training, was more home grown; his entire life, education, professional training, were local. Less eloquent perhaps than Bandaranaike, but not less loquacious; during a political career spanning half a century he has spoken extensively on many subjects, including Buddhist philosophy; expanding on righteousness, exhorting detachment from desires and cravings.",
        "In 1977, armed with a steamroller majority in parliament, Jayewardene went about making radical changes in the country, introducing an entrenched constitution carrying an elected president. He argued that this was necessary for the rapid development as well as political stability of the country. It proved to be a chimera, relative to other countries, particularly in resurgent Asia, there has been little stability and even less economic growth in the 40 something years since.",
        "One of the much spoken of  achievements early in his career was the speech Jayewardene made at the 1951 Peace Conference in San Francisco where he intoned the Buddhist message “hatred ceases not by hatred…”. This was a controversial meeting, the purpose was to make Japan independent, moving forward from being an occupied country.",
        "The Cold War between the West and the Soviet block was raging, and Japan was firmly committed to the former group. America which was the moving force behind the conference was determined to set Japan, its future ally, on the path of independence. The representative of the Soviet Union, which had suffered enormously in the war at the hand of the Axis powers, objected to the terms of the agreement. China which was ravaged by the Japanese army was not even present at the conference. Korea and Southeast Asian countries which were trampled brutally by the Japanese arms were deeply unhappy about the terms. India did not participate.",
        "In truth, the opinion of newly independent Ceylon, a small country which had not experienced the horror of the war in any real sense, was not crucial at the gathering, which was stage managed by the Western block.",
        "But it set a precedence, our representatives at international conferences began making highfalutin speeches while the reality of their country was just the opposite; empty words, insensitive hypocrisy. When deeds are lacking, words will suffice. They also realised that by simply being present at these parleys, with no substantial contribution to the issue, there are benefits of a personal nature to be gained; invitations to similar meetings, possibility of landing a job in an international organisation and, of course, payment in a hard currency.",
        "Meanwhile, internationally Sri Lanka gets no respect. The chief spokesman for the country at the pinnacle international forum is a former judge. According to a former president this controversial judge offered to give judgements favourable to the government if only he was allowed to continue in office.",
        "How seriously should the international community take Sri Lanka’s high moral stand at international gatherings?",
        "Lee Kuan Yew made some clear-eyed observations of the early J.R. Jayewardene government (1977 onwards):",
        "“It was flattering to have Sri Lanka model their country after Singapore. They announced that they would adopt the Singapore style ‘area licensing scheme’ to reduce traffic entering the city. But it did not work. They started a housing programme in 1982 based on ours, but there was no adequate financing. They set up a free trade zone only slightly smaller than the area of Singapore which might have taken off but for the Tamil tigers whose terror tactics scared investors away.”",
        "Was J.R. Jayewardene the visionary politician some imagined, or a dabbler with only a doubtful grasp of the concepts he spoke about, and therefore inclined to interpret them perversely? Did his words express genuine beliefs, or were they just fatuous pieties?",
        "Beneficiaries of a system cannot be expected to challenge it; they will rather attempt to incorporate the newcomer to their tainted tradition, consider him an eager apprentice or a potential convert. To break away from deep rooted ways and habits of a power-structure needs extraordinary character. The task before President Anura Dissanayake is of historical proportion.",
        "To transcend an entrenched and flawed political culture will surely prove to be a herculean challenge!"

        "Due to my deep involvement in the entertainment industry and showbiz, several leading Western musicians in Sri Lanka became my friends from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties. One of those friends was Sohan Weerasinghe, the leader of Sohan & The X’Periments, featuring Estelle and Judy.",
        "In 1991, I received an unexpected call from Sohan. “Mr. J, I just recorded a new English song with the band at my studio. It’s called ‘Whispers in the Sand.’ If I send you the rough mix, would you be willing to share your thoughts?” The request took me by surprise. “Sohan, you know I’m not a musician and don’t have any musical training. I don’t think I’m qualified to give advice,” I replied. Nevertheless, he sent the rough mix my way.",
        "After listening to the song, Sohan called back to hear my opinion. “Sohan, congratulations! ‘Whispers in the Sand’ is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful English songs ever recorded in Sri Lanka. You should create an equally stunning music video for it. If you’re looking for someone to direct and produce it, I’d be eager to take on the challenge.” Sohan enthusiastically agreed and granted me full creative freedom for the project.",
        "At that time, Sri Lankan music videos were quite basic, typically featuring the singer performing with scenic visuals interspersed. I aspired to do something different—a video with a compelling storyline with professional actors or models. My first bold move was to exclude Sohan from appearing in the video. Although shocked, he respected my creative vision and allowed me to proceed as planned.",
        "I quickly learned how to draft a detailed storyboard, consulting film-makers I knew from my acting days. Willie Blake, an award-winning cinematographer and director—and a close friend—was on holiday in Sri Lanka and staying at Mount Lavinia Hotel. His guidance was invaluable during the planning phase. Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) generously provided the location and sponsored the production, while ITN network supported us with technical resources and a skilled crew.",
        "We dedicated an entire day to shooting and spent a full night in ITN’s editing suite, crafting a music video that would go on to be nominated for the Best Music Video of the Year award in 1992.",
        "During the night I spent with Sohan and the ITN editing team, I was introduced to the art of song composition. I was surprised to learn that Sohan first created the tune for ‘Whispers in the Sand’, then wrote the lyrics, and finally invited me to craft a story for the video. Initially, I believed the process should unfold in reverse: story – lyrics – music. In doing so, created my first song composition – ‘Fleeting Moments’ that night.",
        "The song was inspired by a personal experience I had at Bentota Beach Hotel on New Year’s Eve, 1974, when I faced the challenge of having double-booked dance partners – a Sri Lankan teenage girl and a Swiss teenage girl.",
        "Sohan arranged the music for ‘Fleeting Moments’ and performed the song, while I wrote the storyboard and directed the video, which was filmed at Mount Lavinia Hotel during the New Year’s Eve dinner dance at the Empire Ballroom. The song quickly became a hit, climbing the charts and inspiring me to write lyrics for five more songs. Each of these songs reached the top of the charts in Sri Lanka, and three were voted by readers of The Island newspaper as the most popular English songs in the country.",
        "A cross section of 20 leading singers (who sang the song: ‘Fitness Fever’) during the launch of my cassette at the Little Hut Night club in 1993",
        "After producing The Island Music Awards on three occasions, I embarked on my largest production yet. The event, The Show, was staged at Sri Lanka’s largest venue, the BMICH National Convention Centre. At the time, I was also the General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel Catering Services at BMICH. This production marked my final major show in Sri Lanka before I left the country, and I was determined to make it something truly spectacular and unforgettable.",
        "For The Show, I brought my vision to the table and invited input from the musicians on the organizing team. The collaborative process proved to be effective, and most of their suggestions were incorporated. This helped elevate the production to a level far beyond anything I had previously produced in Sri Lanka. I planned the sets and worked with the best set designers in Sri Lanka.",
        "Our team for the show included 153 professionals, ranging from musicians and dancers to choreographers, set designers, sound engineers, lighting experts, special effects specialists, make-up artists, photographers, video recorders, and my trusted stage manager, Kenneth Honter, who was my right-hand man.",
        "We introduced two key features: a complete dress rehearsal at BMICH the day before the performance and a video launch of the show on TV a week later. The show began precisely at 7:00 p.m., with an audience of 1,506 in attendance.",
        "As outlined in my concept document and detailed cue sheet with minute-by-minute steps of the production process, became the team’s map and the compass. The show was divided into two segments, each with contrasting sub-themes. Each segment was supported by distinct music, choreographed dance performances, special effects, lighting, and sound. The production featured two ambitious set changes with groundbreaking special effects, adding an extra layer of excitement to the show’s two contrasting segments.",
        "Sunil Perera congratulating us for winning 1992 Island Music Awards – ‘Most Outstanding Showbiz Personality’ and ‘Entertainer of the Year’ for Sohan, Female Singer of the Year’ for Judy de Silva and ‘Composer of the Year’ for me (shared with Noeline Honter for our song – ‘Nature’).",
        "The first half of the show was themed ‘Nature’, immersing the audience in a lush, vibrant landscape with waterfalls, towering trees, mist, and 34 young ballerinas performing as butterflies, birds, and blossoming flowers in a rainforest awakening at dawn. A gentle ray of morning sunlight gradually revealed the lead singer of the first song, Noeline, as she became visible to the audience. The scene was slow-moving and misty, with a backdrop of greens and blues, enhanced by soft lighting. It was a delicate and joyful celebration of nature’s beauty.",
        "The second half shifted to ‘Future’, depicting humankind’s scientific progress through flying rockets, while also highlighting the destructive impact of short-sighted policies, global warming, wars, and societal disruptions. The atmosphere was intense, with explosive sounds and smoke, complemented by a backdrop of red and orange, with flashing lights to heighten the drama.",
        "In one particularly striking scene, a rocket landed on stage, and militants emerged, taking singer Sohan as a prisoner before flying off, leaving the BMICH stage. This scene served as a stark warning about humanity’s selfish disregard for the planet’s well-being.",
        "Together with Noeline and Sohan, I co-wrote two new songs that aligned with the thematic segments of the show (they did most of the work!). The song ‘Nature’ became a chart-topping hit in Sri Lanka for several weeks. A year later, Noeline and I were jointly honoured with The Island Music Award for ‘Composer of the Year.’",
        "My next composition, ‘Am I Guilty?’, became the most popular song I had written. I followed my usual process of ‘story – lyrics – music’, with Sohan as my co-composer and arranger. I selected Darlene Suby for the lead vocals, with Sohan providing supporting vocals. We filmed the music video at Colombo Airport and the Airport Garden Hotel.",
        "The song dominated the pop charts for eight consecutive weeks as Sri Lanka’s most popular English song. At the same time, I composed another song, ‘Faithful’, which was arranged by Chandralal Fonseka and featured vocals by both Chandralal and Crystal Williams.",
        "My sixth and final song composition, ‘Fitness Fever’, was by far my most ambitious project. The song featured 20 top Sri Lankan Western musicians in the studio and 16 semi-professional actors in the music video. We filmed it over the course of a day at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel. The song quickly ascended to the top of the pop charts, holding the number one spot for three weeks as Sri Lanka’s most popular English song.",
        "I later produced a cassette titled ‘Fitness Fever’, which included four of the songs I had composed. All participating singers, actors, and technicians volunteered their time and expertise, and we donated the entire proceeds to Ranaviru Sevana, a charity dedicated to caring for Sri Lanka Army members who are differently abled due to injuries sustained during the country’s separatist war. To launch the cassette, we held a grand event at the Little Hut nightclub at Mount Lavinia Hotel.",
        "As a lifelong learner, I was grateful for the opportunity to action learn directing music videos for TV, composing songs for radio, and producing large-scale shows for stage. While there are many individuals and groups I wish to thank, I would like to extend a special thank you to one community in particular—the Western Musicians of Sri Lanka, whose collaboration made these creative projects possible. To them, I say, “Thank you for the music and the friendship!”",

        "ECONOMYNEXT – More than 60 Sri Lankans, including military officials, have been included in a list submitted by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) seeking sanctions and travel bans for human rights and economic crimes in the country and multiple universal jurisdiction cases.",
        "The submissions have been sent to the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada as well as the European Union and the United Nations, the ITJP said in a statement.",
        "“In the absence of any criminal accountability to date, it is vital to continue to document past and current crimes, analyse the evidence and use every channel to keep on asserting the truth,” Yasmin Sooka, executive director of ITJP said.",
        "“We hope the new government in the UK will sanction Sri Lankans on Human Rights Day this year (10 December) for their alleged role in war crimes during the end of the country’s conflict,” she said.",
        "The ITJP said the submissions covered gross violations of human rights and significant corruption in respect of the Sri Lankan army, navy, air force, police and intelligence officials, Tamil paramilitaries, as well as civil servants including judges and former ministers.",
        "However, the South Africa-based independent, international, non-profit organisation, did not mention the names of the officials and people in its submission list.",
        "“The gross human rights violations and atrocity crimes include extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, and various forms of sexual violence, perpetrated both during and after the civil war,” ITJP, the organization established in 2013 to promote justice and accountability in Sri Lanka, said in the statement.",
        "“These range from attacks against civilians that may amount to serious international crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity.”",
        "“In addition, the focus is on significant corruption which is structurally embedded in Sri Lankan governance and public institutions which encompasses undue interference with judicial processes that further sets back accountability efforts for underlying human rights violations, as well as abuses of power.”",
        "The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) passed a resolution in March 2021 that has given a mandate for the global body to establish a mechanism to gather evidence outside the country over alleged human rights violations during and after a 26-year war that ended in 2009.",
        "The resolution has allowed the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) “to collect, consolidate, analyse and preserve information and evidence and to develop possible strategies for future accountability processes for gross violations of human rights or serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka.",
        "It is also expected to advocate for victims and survivors, and to support relevant judicial and other proceedings, including in the member states, “with competent jurisdiction”.",
        "A Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security in the last parliament summoned representatives of the country’s Foreign Ministry, Defence Ministry, chief of all three forces, and attorney general to review external mechanisms that have been established as per the UN resolution on evidence gathering mechanism.",
        "The Committee has said in line with the mechanism, legal cases can be filed in different countries under international jurisdictions against the military leaders and those officials who gave orders to the military.",
        "The committee expressed its concerns over any legal actions by various countries against those involved could lead to prosecute Sri Lanka’s military and political leaders at the International Court of Justice ( ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC).",
        "Since the end of the war in 2009, Sri Lanka has strongly rejected any human rights violation and said it had maintained zero casualties in its final war.",
        "However, ITJP said the submissions looked at state-owned enterprises and misappropriation of public funds that resulted in huge financial losses for the entire country, and contributed to the economic crisis in the country.",
        "“Furthermore, visa ban requests have been made for a number of identified former Indian Peacekeeping Force officers alleged to have been complicit in gross human rights violations and mass atrocity crimes, in the period when deployed in Sri Lanka in the late eighties,” it said.",
        "The ITJP has submitted lengthy sanctions dossiers on two former army chiefs – General Shavendra Silva in 2021 and General Jagath Jayasuriya in 2022 to the UK, as well as to the governments of Canada, Australia and the EU.",
        "The US has imposed a travel ban on General Silva and his immediate family members, Navy intelligence officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, Army Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake, army officer Prabath Bulathwatta, and former Navy chief Wasantha Karannagoda, citing human rights violations.",
        "Travel bans have already been imposed on senior retired military leader Shagi Gallage and the former defence secretary Kamal Gunaratne as well, the previous government has admitted.",
        "Canada last year imposed financial sanctions to freeze the assets of former Sri Lankan presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, citing rights abuses.",
        "Some top Sri Lankan military officials have been deprived of taking part in lucrative UN Peacekeeping Missions due to human rights allegations during the war.",
        "Human rights analysts say some Sri Lankan political and military leaders are still unaware that they have been blacklisted by Western nations for rights abuses and will only become aware of such measures when they request visas from these countries.",
        "A Torture Victim Protection Act case was filed in the US against Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019 and a criminal complaint submitted in Singapore in 2022, the ITJP said.",
        "“A further universal jurisdiction case is under investigation in an undisclosed jurisdiction against a retired senior member of the Sri Lankan Army. Additionally, two linked war crimes cases involving suspects from a Sri Lankan Tamil paramilitary group aligned to the military were referred to the UK’s Metropolitan Police which made two arrests and recently put out a public appeal for information.”",
        "The Rajapaksas and military leaders have denied any wrongdoing, and successive governments have rejected an independent international investigation into alleged human rights violations, citing infringement on the country’s sovereignty. (Colombo/December 05/2024)"

By the end of 2022, over 300,000 people had left the country, many of them professionals. These individuals are looking for greener pastures and a way to support their families. Meanwhile, a key obstacle facing potential migrants is English language proficiency assessment, which is a key requirement for migration to popular destinations such as Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries. Against this backdrop, Pearon’s PTE suit of English exams is helping to facilitate these young people as they seek to achieve their dreams on foreign shores. In fact, during 2023, over 3200 applications were made by Sri Lankans seeking Permant Residency status in Canada, with 84% receiving approval, highlighting the promising prospects for aspiring Sri Lankans.",

        "It turned out to be a historic workshop in Sri Lanka since the country signed the much touted Paris Agreement on Climate Action because it was a ‘programmatic session’ where local environment experts were subtly challenged to come up with home-grown green projects to attract local and foreign investors by presenting a convincing climate resilient economic narrative where investors would dare put their money in.",
        "The ADB may have its own ideas for Sri Lanka in this regard with its regional experiences, but the Bank’s intention at the workshop was to find out whether the local experts also had valuable inputs to expand the investment scope with sectoral perspectives from fields such as Agriculture, Water, Energy, Transportation, Tourism etc.",
        "In a nutshell, the forum focused on identifying full scale ready-to-invest projects for climate change adaptation and resilience building.",
        "The following are some excerpts from the speech made by the Country Director of ADB.",
        "“It is an honour to join you at the national inception workshop to launch the ADB regional technical assistances programme focused on “Sustaining Climate and Disaster Risk Resilient and Low Carbon Development in South Asia”.",
        "“Sri Lanka is one of six countries supported by TA9700. This high-level gathering resonates deeply with my personal and professional values. This workshop is a critical platform to amplify public sector voices leading the combat against climate change, a planetary emergency we can no longer ignore. Climate change is regarded worldwide as an overarching development challenge. It can seriously affect economic growth, food security, public health, cultural heritage, social stability, migration, and even the national security of countries.",
        "‘Sri Lanka is a negligible contributor to global warming. However, as a nation, we are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which include increases in the frequency and intensity of disasters uch as droughts, floods and landslides, variability and unpredictability of rainfall patterns, increase in temperature and heat stress; sea level rise, and salinity intrusion among others. Living and coping with uncertain impacts of climate change is no longer a choice; it is an imperative. Sri Lanka needs to address climate change adaptation to ensure that its economic development can continue without disruption or setbacks, so that investments in poverty reduction, food and water security, and public health will not be undone. Given the severity and the far-reaching impacts of climate change affecting every aspect of our lives and our nation, our response must be integrated, sustainable, just, and inclusive”.",
        "“We share a common goal of securing the transition to net zero emissions and a climate-resilient future both of which are critical to sustainable development and economic growth. Responsive measures such as decarbonization, climate change adaptation, and resilience building are all essential; and achieving this transformation across the development sectors, requires horizontal cooperation among the stakeholders, development partners and strong public and private finance commitments. Sri Lanka now has a unique opportunity to rebuild from the pandemic and economic recession and secure a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable future. We need strong commitment from the Government of Sri Lanka and unwavering cooperation among partners to make this happen. Sri Lanka can lead by example. ADB will fully support the Government of Sri Lanka through our sovereign and private sector operations, technical assistances, and knowledge partnerships.”",
        "“This workshop is the beginning of an extensive consultation process to the views of a wide range of stakeholders on how we can develop an integrated climate responsive investment plan for Sri Lanka” , he said.",

TISL is deeply concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding this project, which has raised significant economic and ecological concerns.” a TISL news release said..",
        "“Recently it was reported that Sri Lanka will be paying a fixed price of 8.26 US cents per KW (subject to payment in Sri Lankan Rupees as per the actual foreign exchange rate) generated from wind power over the next 20 years. The relevant proposal forwarded by the Power and Energy Minister received the Cabinet approval on May 6, 2024. This unit price contrasts starkly with the current global price, and the continuously decreasing costs associated with wind power generation. According to the statistics of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind fell by 56%, from 8 US cents to 3 US cents per KW between 2010 and 2022.",

Concerns have also been raised about the credibility of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process.",

These requests primarily seek information on:",

        "3. Pricing and cost benefits: Documentation demonstrating energy and cost benefits for Sri Lanka, unit price decided for the Project, and justification for any pricing higher than market rates.",
        "4. Need and risk assessments: Details about need assessment and risk assessment conducted for the Project, and mitigation methods outlined for potential risks.",

        "7. Land Acquisition: Whether the land acquisition in Mannar and Pooneryn was approved by Cabinet, whether the procedure laid out in the Land Acquisition Act is being followed, and documents detailing the locations, extent and the demarcation of the lands approved for acquisition.",
        "“TISL notes that it has not received comprehensive and timely responses to most of these queries so far, and therefore has resorted to the next step of appealing to relevant designated officers of the authorities.",

        "The legislation further criminalizes online communication that constitutes contempt of court, as well as both general online fraud and fraudulent activity involving impersonation.",
        "Any person, whether in or outside Sri Lanka who communicates any false statement, with intent to cause any officer, sailor, soldier, or airman in the navy, army or air force of Sri Lanka to mutiny, or with intent to cause fear or alarm to the public, induces any other person to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity, commits an offence and shall on conviction be liable to both such imprisonment and fine.",

        "The order issued on Monday relates to the non-payment of over Rs. 3 million in Value Added Tax (VAT) owed to the Government.

Counsel Dinesh Perera, representing the Inland Revenue Commissioner General, urged the Court to summon Ratnayake and his wife directly, emphasising the need for their presence to address the substantial unpaid tax.",

        "ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘A(lka)’ with a stable outlook, saying the economy was stabilizing but it also had the highest exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds.",
        "HNB’s high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds which at 10 percent of assets by end 2023, was the highest among local banks.",
        "Another 33 percent of assets iwere rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign’s repayment capacity and liquidity position.",
        "“Fitch expects HNB’s impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch’s anticipated expansion in the bank’s loan book,” Fitch said.",
        "“This is despite the parate suspension that is in effect until 15 December 2024.”",
        "High internal capital generation through retained profits and gains from currency appreciation had boosted HNB’s regulatory Tier 1 ratio to 14.7 percent by end-2023 (2022: 11.4 percent).",
        "That said, we estimate the bank’s underlying capital buffers to be lower by around 100bp if a 100 percent risk weighting were applied (currently 20 percent) on these defaulted bonds.",
        "Fitch Ratings – Colombo – 06 Jun 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC’s (HNB) National Long-Term Rating at ‘A(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed HNB’s Sri Lankan rupee senior unsecured debt at ‘A(lka)’. The ratings on the bank’s proposed and outstanding Sri Lankan rupee subordinated debt have been affirmed at ‘BBB+(EXP)(lka)’ and ‘BBB+(lka)’, respectively.",
        "Intrinsic Profile Drives Rating: HNB’s National Long-Term Rating reflects its own financial strength, which is highly influenced by the bank’s exposure to the sovereign’s weak credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): RD; Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) and the ongoing sovereign debt restructuring, which has put pressure on HNB’s financial profile, particularly capitalisation and funding. The rating also reflects HNB’s superior domestic franchise as Sri Lanka’s fourth-largest commercial bank.",
        "Restructuring Delays Hinder Progress: Sri Lankan banks’ operating environment (OE) continues to show signs of stabilisation, supporting the recovery in banks’ operational flexibility. There are sustained improvements in reported headline macroeconomic indicators, but persistent delays in the completion of the sovereign debt restructuring could impede the progress made so far, in Fitch’s view.",
        "Exposure to Sovereign Risks: HNB’s high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currencydenominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 10% of assets) and a further 33% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign’s repayment capacity and liquidity position. HNB has the highest exposure to sovereign bonds among local banks.",
        "Sovereign Default Affects Asset Quality: HNB’s asset quality metrics are burdened by its large holdings in defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds, in addition to loan quality stresses already facing the bank (6% of assets). Fitch expects HNB’s impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch’s anticipated expansion in the bank’s loan book. This is despite the parate suspension that is in effect until 15 December 2024.",
        "Sovereign Risk Pressures Capital: The sovereign’s external debt restructuring, including the defaulted sovereign bonds, and the rupee-denominated government securities, weigh on HNB’s capitalisation metrics. High internal capital generation through retained profits and gains from currency appreciation bolstered HNB’s regulatory Tier 1 ratio to 14.7% by end-2023 (2022: 11.4%). That said, we estimate the bank’s underlying capital buffers to be lower by around 100bp if a 100% riskweighting were applied (currently 20%) on these defaulted bonds.",
        "Risks to Earnings Manageable: The bank’s operating profit/risk-weighted assets ratio improved to 5.9% by end-1Q24, due primarily to lower credit costs, which more than offset the decrease in the net interest margin (1Q24: 5.5%, 2023: 7.0%).",
        "We expect the bank’s profitability metrics to normalise as the yield benefit from its high-yielding government securities tapers off. This is despite the potential for oneoff losses from the restructuring of sovereign bonds, should these outstrip existing provisions (52% of the balance sheet exposure).",
        "Funding and Liquidity Risks Persist: We believe HNB’s funding and liquidity stresses have eased relative to the crisis period, on both the foreign and local currency fronts given more favourable external sector flows and the bank’s focus on liquidity preservation, as reflected in higher liquidity coverage ratio. However, improvements in foreign-currency liquidity remain susceptible to sudden changes in creditor sentiment. The bank’s ability to access foreign-currency wholesale funding remains constrained by the sovereign’s weak credit profile, similar to peers.",
        "Economic Conditions Supports New Lending: Fitch expects Sri Lanka’s stabilising macroeconomic environment to support HNB’s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but the bank’s business profile remains constrained by the high risks in the OE. Fitch also expects the resumption in lending in the sector, albeit",
        "modest, to enhance HNB’s share of assets in net loans, which fell to 47% by end1Q24 (2022: 56%) on muted lending opportunities and increased liquidity preservation.",
        "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
        "The bank’s National Rating is sensitive to a change in the bank’s creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
        "Deterioration in HNB’s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also increase downward pressure on the bank’s rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
        "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
        "Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade in the bank’s rating.",
        "A sustained improvement in the bank’s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade of the bank’s rating.",
        "Senior Debt: HNB’s outstanding senior unsecured debentures are rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating in accordance with Fitch’s criteria. This is because the issue ranks equally with the claims of the bank’s other senior unsecured creditors.",
        "Subordinated Debt: HNB’s Basel III-compliant Sri Lankan rupee subordinated debt is rated two notches below the National Long-Term Rating anchor. This reflects Fitch’s baseline notching for loss severity for this type of debt and our expectation of poor recoveries. There is no additional notching for non-performance risks, as the notes do not incorporate going-concern loss-absorption features.",
        "The senior and subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the bank’s National Long-Term Rating.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP), a leftist coalition led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), recently visited India at the invitation of the Indian government. The visit is significant; it underscores the emergence of the NPP as a major political force in Sri Lanka, one that is being courted by major powers.",
        "During its five-day official visit to India, which began on February 5, the NPP delegation held meetings with senior Indian officials, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, toured key agricultural and industrial hubs, and visited key business giants like Tata Motors and the Indian multinational cooperative society, Amul. The delegation visited New Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Thiruvananthapuram.",
        "Formed in 2015 with the JVP as its core, the NPP comprises around 28 political parties and workers unions, women’s organizations, etc., and is led by JVP chief, Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.",
        "Since its formation, it has been considered by its political opponents as a fringe political alliance with no prospects of coming to power. The NPP performed poorly in the 2019 presidential election and the 2020 general election: its presidential candidate, Dissanayaka, secured just 3 percent of the votes, and it won just three seats in the Sri Lankan parliamentary election.",
        "However, its political fortunes seem to be improving over the last couple of years.",
        "Even its adversaries admit that the NPP has emerged as the most successful force in post-aragalaya (the powerful anti-government protests of 2022) Sri Lanka. A recent opinion poll conducted by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) indicated that if elections were to be held now, the NPP would have a significant lead over the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Sri Lanka’s main opposition party, in terms of voter preference.",
        "Since the mass protests of 2022, the NPP has focused on grassroots mobilization, capitalizing on the economic crisis and delegitimization of the ruling political forces.",
        "The then-ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which is led by the Rajapaksa family, bore the brunt of public dissatisfaction for causing the economic downturn. The protests forced the resignation of several members of the family, including President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
        "Their exit led to an SLPP-backed government headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe of the United National Party (UNP). The SLPP and the UNP are currently implementing an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-dictated austerity program that is hugely unpopular in the country.",
        "With the center-right SJB, whose economic policy is dictated by economists supportive of IMF policies, failing to capitalize on the mass discontent due to the limitations of its political agenda, space has opened up for the NPP to take on a larger role in opposition politics.",
        "It is increasingly evident that the NPP is a major political force in Sri Lanka today and the possibility of it winning the presidential and general elections that are to be held this year cannot be ruled out.",
        "Dismayed by the growing mass support for the NPP, politicians from the SLPP, UNP, and SJB have increasingly invested in a narrative that the leftist coalition has little standing in the international community.",
        "Contrary to such claims, several institutions like the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the IMF, as well as members of the Western diplomatic corps, have been reaching out to engage NPP leaders.",
        "Another common claim made by the NPP’s rivals is that it leans toward China and that India views the party unfavorably given the JVP’s anti-Indian past.",
        "When the JVP was established in the mid-1960s as a breakaway group of the Community Party – Peking Wing, one of the main ideas it espoused was “anti-Indian expansionism.” In the late 1980s, the JVP again returned to this theme following the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which led to the implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution and the arrival of the Indian Peacekeeping Force.",
        "Since its return to mainstream politics in the mid-1990s, the JVP has avoided similar anti-Indian rhetoric. However, the party has been at the forefront of efforts to block the sale of strategic Sri Lankan assets to India.",
        "While an NPP delegation did visit China in December following an official invitation from the Communist Party of China, it followed up on that visit with one to India.",
        "The recent invitation from the Indian government and the fact that both Jaishankar and Doval met the NPP delegation indicates that New Delhi sees the NPP as a major political force in Sri Lanka, one that it cannot ignore.",
        "The India visit is a major public relations victory for the NPP. Dissanayaka was described by India’s influential English daily, The Hindu, as the “island nation’s most popular politician.” The visit is likely to have alleviated fears of international isolation under NPP rule among Sri Lanka’s middle class.",
        "The Sri Lankan political establishment, i.e. the SLPP, UNP and SJB, are trying to downplay the importance of the NPP’s India visit and portraying it as an example of the unprincipled nature of the NPP.",
        "Simultaneously, India too has benefited from its recent engagement with the NPP delegation by establishing personal connections with key figures, notably Dissanayaka, potentially the country’s future executive president. This engagement serves to mitigate concerns about potential anti-Indian sentiments in the NPP/JVP leadership. The reaction to the visit by other political parties underscores the need for a Sri Lankan political party to have cordial relations with India.",
        "The NPP visit has prompted several other Sri Lankan politicians to visit India and seek audiences with Indian politicians. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of Mahinda Rajapaksa who is being groomed as a future leader, is already in India. The SJB, which is one of the biggest casualties of the NPP visit, is reported to have asked the Indian High Commission in Colombo to arrange a visit to India.",
        "Sri Lankan politicians seeking Indian blessing is also a win for the Indian foreign policy establishment at a time when India’s relationship with its neighbors is at a low.",
        "However, it is unlikely that the NPP’s visit to India would bring a drastic change in its stance toward its giant neighbor. While the NPP is not an anti-India party, one of the main reasons for its popularity is that it has fought against the selling of national assets to foreign companies.",
        "It has campaigned against India’s Adani Group taking control over Sri Lankan ports, renewable energy, and airports. Leaders and associates of the NPP are also at the forefront of the movement against the sale of the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) to India’s Amul.",
        "While the visit has improved relations between the NPP and India and showcased the former as a major political force in Sri Lanka, the divergence on the Adani issue underscores the complexities that will dog their relationship.",

It is possible to extend the term of President and Parliament. It can be done after seeking an interpretation from the judiciary,” Marasinghe told a briefing.",

No development or reform programmes can be implemented during this period. The debt restructuring and other reforms would take a back seat in such an eventuality. Therefore, the country will definitely go backward at least by a year if an election is held. Accordingly, the country has two options at this moment. That is to hold an election or postpone the polls. This is what UNP General Secretary was talking about. Many have got unnecessarily excited about his remark,” he added.",

      "original_title": "LGBTIQ+ matters: Creating positive space at universities",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "I teach in a postgraduate programme on gender and health offered by the Faculty of Medicine, Colombo. In the module I coordinate on gender-responsive healthcare, we discuss, among other things, the experience of LGBTIQ+ persons within the health sector. The situation is quite bleak. According to the activists who teach in the module, most health professionals lack basic training on delivering sex-/gender-responsive health services. A 2023 study carried out by EQUAL GROUND in six districts (Colombo, Galle, Jaffna, Kandy, Matale, Polonnaruwa) describes varied experiences of stigmatization, discrimination, verbal/physical abuse and sexual harassment in the hands of healthcare providers.",
        "These conversations led me to reflect on the situation of LGBTIQ+ folk at our universities. A 2021 nation-wide survey among 4500 people in all 25 districts in the country found 12% of the population identified as LGBTIQ+ (EQUAL GROUND 2021). This means over 10 percent of our students (and staff) may identify as belonging to these groups. Yet, they remain invisible within universities. At the Faculty of Medicine, Jaffna, where I teach, I have had just one student confide in me about their sexual orientation during the past eight years. I recall attending an event organized by a trans advocacy group in Jaffna when a medical student swiftly left the premises on my entry, probably fearing I would find out about their sexual orientation/gender identity. When I reached out through my networks to academics at other state universities, they reported similar experiences, indicating the sorry state of affairs at universities.",
        "Heteronormativity assumes most or all people are straight and cisgender. Heteronormative institutions, like our universities, promote heterosexuality and the gender binary. An academic at Peradeniya University observed, “I should imagine that universities are not easy for those who are uncomfortable with a rigid gender binary… when these norms are violated, during the ragging period for instance, the consequences can be quite harsh.” Students are reluctant to express their sexual orientation openly. It is rare to see butch or femme students (or anything in between) on our campuses. Another staff member at Peradeniya suggested that the situation of staff may be marginally better, “No staff [in our faculty] is openly gay, and while among staff, a live and let live sentiment might exist, it is harder for students…”",
        "Several academics identified ragging as an apparatus that sustains heteronormativity. As a professor explained, “…ragging is hugely reliant on imposing sexual normativeness, even as it sneakily flirts with marginal sexuality. This double bind of ragging has to be addressed and recognized for what it can do to vulnerable people, particularly sexually marginalized communities of students.” Whether among staff or by students, attire is strictly monitored with dress codes in place at many faculties. According to an academic at Jaffna University, “The ban on shorts imposed by our university with the strong backing of the students should be understood as an attempt to control and regulate people’s expressions of gender.” The university ‘subculture’ excludes LGBTIQ+ persons from certain spaces, for instance, the unwritten rule that only (heterosexual) couples may venture into the much talked about Lover’s Lane at Peradeniya.",
        "Sadly, university and faculty administrations promote heterosexual and cis-gender norms in various ways. Several health professional programmes implement dress codes, frequently discriminating against certain genders (and ethnicities). Some faculties of medicine ban specific forms of dress on campus, even outside hospital settings. For example, one of the faculties specifies that denim jeans, tank tops, t-shirts, tops with thin straps, mini-skirts/dresses, shorts, capri pants, rubber slippers, and niqab are not acceptable for women, and t-shirts, denims, combat pants, shorts, three-quarter pants, slippers and rubber slippers are no-no’s for men. Such dress codes leave LGBTIQ+ students (and others) with fewer options.",
        "The built environment of the university places transgender folks in an uncomfortable place. Most universities do not have gender neutral washrooms. A similar problem exists in relation to student hostels and halls of residence, which are strictly segregated by gender. Concerns about violence in the halls of residence against trans people deter them from using university accommodation. Similar fears compel trans students to wait till they complete their degree programmes to commence the transitioning process. “A university student I once worked with said, ‘I’ll wait until I finish my BA before I decide to transit to a male identity’”, said a staff member from Peradeniya.",
        "However, covert expressions of gender/sexual diversity do exist in campus settings. Graffiti can be an interesting indicator and there are more non-normative sexual practices out there on campus, than people want to talk about. In some universities, it is not uncommon for students to include drag in theatrical productions, although often borrowing derogatory tropes from South Asian cinema.",
        "Any form of gender expression that rocks the gender boat would certainly be frowned upon by both the majority of staff and students. Cultural arguments are frequently put forward by conservative elements against addressing LGBTIQ+ concerns at universities. For instance, some assume that being ‘woke’ may result in cultural degradation, while others believe the push to decriminalize same-sex relations is driven by a ‘Western agenda’ that will eventually lead to a decline in the population. Others problematically link non-hetero/cis sexual orientations/gender identities to childhood trauma or sexual abuse.",
        "Although bylaws/policies on gender equality/equity at universities commit to gender equality, it is unclear whether these policies aim to transcend the gender binary. Encouraging is that one such policy explicitly refers to “[promoting] equality and [combating] discrimination among the University’s employees and students, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and age.” Indeed, discussions on LGBTIQ+ concerns do take place tangentially at various forums, but often reach an impasse. In Peradeniya, these discussions are “for some unfathomable reason interspersed with sexist jokes and talk about how men are the marginalized group,” according to an academic at the university.",
        "None of the universities explicitly offer support services for LGBTIQ+ students. As a senior lecturer at Colombo University stated, “As far as I know, there are no student groups or services in the university that are focused on supporting LGBTIQ+ students.” She went on to suggest that the students at her university may have better access to support services by virtue of the university being located in Colombo where several non-governmental organizations offer support. A Peradeniya academic described how Tamil-speaking counsellors trained in dealing with LGBTIQ+ concerns are virtually non-existent. Due to the lack of better options, students encounter counsellors who usually advise them to reject their preferred sexual orientation or gender identity as if taking on such identities is deliberate. “In the absence of counsellors who are specially trained in sensitivity and with the necessary training to handle trauma, students are trapped in a spell of inarticulation.”",
        "At present, students rely on sympathetic friends and lecturers, if they do find the courage to come out openly. According to a lecturer at Colombo University: “Students appear to know which departments/staff members are allies … departments of English are usually known to be friendly spaces.” In rare instances, high-ranking university officials have expressed solidarity with LGBTIQ+ movements. A lecturer at the Jaffna pointed out, “A couple of years back the VC participated in an LGBTIQ walk organized by local activist group within the premises of the University…while such actions are encouraging and signal the existence of space to engage on these issues, what we need are changes at the level of governance, policy and curriculum.”",
        "Positive spaces at universities are unlikely to flourish until we see changes in the Penal Code, which criminalize same-sex activity. A host of activist organizations and even the Sri Lanka College of Psychiatrists have called for decriminalizing ‘homosexuality’ and a change in article 365. The legal status of same-sex activity prevents students from coming out, although identifying as LGBTIQ+ is not a violation of the Penal Code. As a result, those who express their sexual orientation/gender identities overtly in the classroom tend to be more privileged, and critical discussions remain within closed environments.",
        "What is ironic is that sexual orientation and gender identity have been historically fluid in this part of the world. As one professor explained, “If one takes epics like Mahabharata for instance, one can very easily see the embodiment of a plethora of identities. Down the passage of time, and across the world, we find these contestations. These discussions can create spaces for marginal voices to tell a story.” As members of the university community, we could work towards breaking the silence on LGBTIQ+ matters and creating positive space at our universities.",

        "In Sri Lanka, companies that have embraced gender equality and diversity have reaped the rewards of a diverse workforce. For example, MAS Holdings, a leading apparel manufacturer in Sri Lanka, has prioritsed gender diversity and inclusion in its workforce, with women occupying key leadership positions across the organization",
        "International Women’s Day 2024 provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the significant contributions of women to the economy of Sri Lanka. From labor force participation to entrepreneurship and leadership roles, women play a crucial role in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and building resilient communities. This article aims to highlight the latest data and statistics showcasing women’s contributions to the economy, explore the economic benefits of gender diversity and inclusion, discuss the challenges and barriers women face, showcase success stories of women entrepreneurs and leaders, examine the role of education and skills development, and call for continued efforts to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the economy.",
        "Labour Force Participation: According to the latest data from the Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka, women’s participation in the labor force has been steadily increasing over the years. In 2023, the female labor force participation rate stood at 36.5%, up from 32.1% in 2013. This trend reflects the growing presence of women in various sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, services, and agriculture.",
        "Entrepreneurship: Women in Sri Lanka have made significant strides in entrepreneurship, with a growing number of women-owned businesses contributing to economic development. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report, the rate of female entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka increased from 9.8% in 2013 to 12.4% in 2023. This highlights the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation among women entrepreneurs in the country.",
        "Leadership Positions: Despite facing challenges, women in Sri Lanka have made notable progress in occupying leadership positions in various industries. According to a report by Catalyst, a global nonprofit organisation, women held 18.5% of board seats in listed companies in Sri Lanka in 2023, up from 15.7% in 2013. This indicates a positive shift towards greater gender diversity in corporate leadership.",
        "Gender diversity and inclusion in the workforce bring numerous benefits to businesses and the economy as a whole. Research has shown that companies with diverse leadership teams and workforces tend to outperform their peers in terms of productivity, profitability, and corporate performance. A study by McKinsey & Company found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile.",
        "In Sri Lanka, companies that have embraced gender equality and diversity have reaped the rewards of a diverse workforce. For example, MAS Holdings, a leading apparel manufacturer in Sri Lanka, has prioritsed gender diversity and inclusion in its workforce, with women occupying key leadership positions across the organisation. This commitment to gender equality has not only enhanced MAS Holdings’ reputation as a socially responsible employer but has also contributed to its success in the global market.",
        "Despite the progress made, women in Sri Lanka continue to face various challenges and barriers in accessing economic opportunities. Gender pay gaps persist, with women earning less than men for the same work. According to a study by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the gender pay gap in Sri Lanka stood at 13.2% in 2023, highlighting the need for pay equity measures to address this issue.",
        "Limited access to finance and resources is another significant barrier faced by women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. Women-owned businesses often struggle to access funding from financial institutions due to factors such as lack of collateral and discriminatory lending practices. This hinders their ability to start and grow their businesses, limiting their potential contribution to the economy.",
        "Cultural biases and stereotypes also pose challenges for women in the workforce, with gender-based discrimination prevalent in hiring, promotion, and leadership opportunities. Addressing these deep-rooted biases requires concerted efforts from policymakers, businesses, and civil society to promote gender equality and create a more inclusive and equitable economy.",
        "Despite the challenges they face, women entrepreneurs and leaders in Sri Lanka have achieved remarkable success in their respective fields, contributing to job creation, innovation, and community development. One such success story is that of India’s Indra Nooyi, who served as the CEO of PepsiCo, one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies.",
        "Nooyi’s journey from humble beginnings to the pinnacle of corporate leadership serves as an inspiration to aspiring women entrepreneurs and leaders in the country. Her visionary leadership and commitment to diversity and inclusion have earned her widespread recognition and accolades, demonstrating the transformative power of women’s leadership in driving business success.",
        "Investing in women’s education and skills development is crucial for unlocking their full potential and bridging gender gaps in the labor market. Education empowers women with the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to pursue meaningful careers and achieve economic independence. In Sri Lanka, efforts to promote girls’ education and vocational training have contributed to increased female participation in the workforce and improved economic outcomes for women.",
        "Mentorship programs and networking opportunities also play a vital role in empowering women to succeed in the economy. By connecting women with mentors and role models who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement, these programs help women navigate the challenges they face and advance their careers.",
        "It is essential to recognise the intersectionality of gender with other dimensions of identity, such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and its implications for women’s economic opportunities and outcomes. Women from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds face intersecting forms of discrimination and barriers to economic empowerment, exacerbating gender inequalities.",
        "Addressing intersectional discrimination requires an inclusive approach that considers the unique experiences and needs of diverse groups of women. This includes implementing targeted policies and programs that address the specific challenges faced by marginalised women and promoting inclusive economic growth that benefits all segments of society.",
        "As we celebrate International Women’s Day 2024, it is imperative to acknowledge the progress made in advancing gender equality while recognising the work that remains to be done. To accelerate progress toward gender equality and empower women in the economy, policymakers, businesses, and civil society organisations must prioritise gender-responsive policies and initiatives. This includes:",

        "Enhancing Access to Finance: Providing women entrepreneurs with greater access to financial resources, including loans, grants, and venture capital, to support the growth and expansion of their businesses.",
        "Promoting Gender Diversity in Leadership: Encouraging companies to adopt policies and practices that promote gender diversity in leadership positions, including setting targets for female representation on boards and executive teams.",
        "Investing in Education and Skills Development: Investing in quality education and vocational training programs that equip women with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the workforce.",

        "Advancing Intersectional Approaches: Recognising the intersecting forms of discrimination faced by marginalised women and implementing inclusive policies that address their unique needs and challenges.",
        "By taking concerted action on these fronts, Sri Lanka can unlock the full economic potential of women, drive sustainable growth, and create a more inclusive and equitable society for all. On International Women’s Day 2024 and beyond, let us reaffirm our commitment to empowering women in the economy and accelerating progress towards gender equality.",
        "In conclusion, celebrating the impact of women on the economy of Sri Lanka is not just a matter of recognition; it is a strategic imperative for driving sustainable development and inclusive growth. By investing in women’s education, entrepreneurship, and leadership, addressing systemic barriers and biases, and promoting gender diversity and inclusion, Sri Lanka can harness the full potential of its female workforce and build a more prosperous and equitable future for all. As we mark International Women’s Day 2024, let us commit to empowering women, accelerating progress, and creating a world where every woman has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the economy and society at large.",

        "In this crucial election year, we need to ask ourselves why it is necessary to change the existing system – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara",
        "Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next Presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18 November 2024. As far as I am aware, no Member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious? Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?",
        "The leader of the SLFP, Maithripala Sirisena, has publicly declared that he supports the abolition of the executive powers of the President. In 2019, the JVP’s Anura Kumara Dissanayake presented a Bill to enable the then non-executive President to be elected by Parliament. In 2021, SJB leader Sajith Premadasa proposed a constitutional amendment to enable a non-executive President to be elected by Parliament. None of these political leaders now show any inclination to implement their previous commitments. Instead, they have publicly announced their intention to seek election to the office of Executive President. The chief whip of the Opposition offers a hilarious half-way deal: first hold the Presidential election; then abolish the office!",
        "Lawyer-parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila sees the call for abolishing the executive presidency as “part of a conspiracy to postpone the next Presidential election”. He argues that since the Supreme Court has previously held that a parliamentary vote to remove the executive powers of the President should be followed by a referendum, “if a person challenges the validity of the referendum, the executive presidency will not be abolished pending the Supreme Court determination, and the incumbent President can remain in power until the dissolution of Parliament in August 2025. He explains that the hearing of a petition could take six months or even longer.",
        "The responsibility to give effect to what is now an increasingly vocal public demand surely rests with the Head of Government, the incumbent President. In 2013, the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led UNP published the text of the principles upon which a new Constitution would be formulated after it forms a government. Among them was that the executive presidency would be abolished. In 2018, the Government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe prepared and published a draft Constitution which required the President to be elected by Parliament and to exercise his/her powers on advice. It is surely the responsibility, if not the obligation, of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to set in motion the legal processes necessary to achieve that objective before time begins to run out.",
        "The first step should be to reform the electoral system. Since the list system of election to Parliament, based on proportional representation, is an integral element in the executive presidential system of governance, the Constitution will need to be amended to replace that system with the first past-the-post system of single and multi-member constituencies that prevailed under the 1946 and 1972 Constituencies. These will need to be supplemented with an element of proportional representation to ensure that minorities are adequately represented, and that there is equitable distribution of seats based on the totality of votes cast for each political party. Following the passage of this constitutional amendment by a two-third majority, the delimitation of electorates will need to commence immediately.",
        "The next step should be another constitutional amendment for the following purposes:",
        "Establish the office of President of the Republic who shall be the Head of State, the Head of the Executive, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.",
        "Establish the offices of two Vice-Presidents who shall belong to two different ethnic groups, and neither of whom should belong to the ethnic group of the President.",
        "The President and Vice-Presidents shall be elected by Parliament. The term of office of the President and Vice-Presidents shall be four/six years.",
        "The President and Vice Presidents shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, act on the advice of the Prime Minister, or of such other Minister to whom the Prime Minister may have given authority to advise the President or a Vice-President on any function assigned to that Minister.",
        "Whenever the President is prevented by illness or other cause from performing the duties of his office or is absent from Sri Lanka a Vice-President designated by the Prime Minister shall act in the office of President.",
        "A Bill for the above purposes will require to be passed with a two-thirds majority. The Constitution does not require such a Bill to be approved at a referendum. However, the Supreme Court has been inconsistent on this question. In 2015, Chief Justice Sripavan and two other Judges held that the 19th Amendment (which required the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister) was not required to be approved at a referendum, but different benches of Judges have since, in my view erroneously, held that approval at a referendum is required. Therefore, it is advisable for the Government to state at the outset that it intends to submit the Bill to a referendum. This Bill, after being approved at a referendum, will come into force upon being certified by the President.",
        "The third and final step would be to dissolve Parliament, and fix dates for receiving nominations and for conducting the poll. The general election and the referendum could be held on the same day. If the President-in-office intends to be a candidate at the general election, he will need to resign his office upon issuing the proclamation dissolving Parliament. Since the incumbent Prime Minister may also be a candidate, the proposed Bill for the 23rd Amendment will need to make provision for the incumbent President to nominate a suitable person who is not a member of any political party to serve as interim president, and for such interim president to hold office until Parliament, after the general election, elects the President.",
        "During a brief conversation on a flight to Colombo, four months after he had been elected by Parliament to the vacant office of President, Ranil Wickremesinghe mentioned to me that one of his priorities was to solve the ethnic problem. I had no reason to disbelieve him. In fact, I accepted, and still do accept, that he had set that as a priority for himself during his tenure in the highest office in our country. Unfortunately, his belief that the full implementation of the provisions in the Constitution introduced by the 13th Amendment in 1987, during a bloody civil war, would achieve that objective is unfounded.",
        "The strident response of the TNA spokesman Sumanthiran that nothing short of federalism will satisfy the Tamil population in the North and East, demonstrates the futility of seeking a solution based on that much maligned controversial constitutional amendment. Equally unfounded is his belief that a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (which is based on the Christian concept of Confession) will be appropriate for our country.",
        "If President Wickremesinghe’s objective is national reconciliation and reintegration, Sri Lanka needs a new Constitution with a strong democratic foundation and based on the recognition that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-linguistic country. The Constitution must also assert that Sri Lanka is a secular country, as Singapore does, in which everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and does not need the intervention of the State to exercise that right.",
        "It is desirable that a new Constitution should also contain the following provisions:",
        "The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka will be restored to its original name “The Republic of Sri Lanka”.",
        "22 May will be recognised as “Republic Day”, while 4 February will continue to be recognised as “Independence Day”.",
        "Sinhala, Tamil, and English shall be the official languages, with English being the medium of instruction at the secondary and tertiary levels.",
        "The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which Sri Lanka has ratified, will be incorporated in the Constitution and be enforceable, including in respect of existing laws.",
        "A Constitutional Court will be established. Its jurisdiction will include the issuance of writs and the ex-post facto review of legislation. It may also serve as the court of final appeal in respect of important questions of law.",
        "A 30-member Senate will be established as the upper chamber of Parliament (perhaps consisting of representatives of professional organisations), with a 175/200-member House of Representatives as the lower chamber.",
        "A new Constitution to replace the 21-times amended, author-unknown, and drafting-process-unknown, 1978 Constitution, is the real need of the hour. It will obviate the necessity to adopt the 22nd and 23rd Amendments referred to above. It will need a general election before it becomes fully operative, but it will not require a referendum to bring it into force. If the 1946 Constitution could have been drafted by a young assistant legal draftsman in three months, using a borrowed typewriter to work on; and if the 1972 Constitution could have been drafted in even less time, both at little or no expense to the State, there is no reason why a new Constitution for Sri Lanka cannot be drafted and adopted by Parliament before the Elections Commission begins the process of electing a new Executive President.",
        "In this crucial election year, we need to ask ourselves why it is necessary to change the existing system. In answering that question, we must have regard not only to the manner in which this country has been governed during the past five decades, but also to the quality of governance in the world around us with which we must necessarily interact. We need to look ahead to the next 25 years and ask whether the constrictive framework of governance prescribed in the 1970s is appropriate or adequate to meet the challenges of the new millennium.",

        "The government is going hell for leather to bring forth electoral reforms as if there were no tomorrow. It would have the public believe that the current electoral systems are full of flaws, which need to be rectified as a national priority if the country is to be put right and progress ushered in.",
        "System bashing, as it were, has become the vogue in this country. Everyone is calling for a system change these days. Even those who have ruined the economy and enriched themselves at the expense of the public are doing so obviously in a bid to deflect criticism directed at them. A country doubtlessly needs robust systems in all sectors, but what Sri Lanka needs more than anything else, at the present juncture, is the restoration of the rule of law.",
        "Former Chairman of the Election Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya, at a discussion on electoral reforms, the other day, rightly pointed out that unsavoury characters must not be nominated to contest elections. Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC, was also present at the event. In response to Minister Rajapakshe’s criticism of the current electoral system, Deshapriya said the problem of miscreants being elected to political institutions had to be tackled at source. He argued that the political parties had to refrain from nominating malefactors. One could not agree with him more.",
        "All political parties conduct interviews to select candidates, and, therefore, it is the party leaders who have to take responsibility for nominating political dregs to contest elections. They must sift out miscreants at that point. This will be half the battle in cleansing politics and raising the standards of political institutions, especially Parliament.",
        "Minister Rajapakshe argued that the rogues who were rich enough to throw money around obtained the highest preferential votes at elections. This argument is not without some merit, but there have been numerous instances where moneybags could not overtake other candidates in elections.",
        "In the 2004 parliamentary polls, several members of the JVP, which contested as a constituent of the SLFP-led UPFA, came first in districts such as Colombo, Gampaha and Kurunegala. Obviously, they fared so well in spite of being outspent by many other candidates. Dullas Alahapperuma conducts very clean and inexpensive election campaigns, which are free from polythene, posters, cutouts, etc. He has disproved the argument that the Proportional Representation system has made election campaigns extremely costly. He wins handsomely in the Matara District. Why can’t others emulate him?",
        "There is also a campaign against the preferential vote or  manape, which is made out to be a source of evil. If it is scrapped, political party leaders will be able to nominate their favourites to contest elections and enable them to enter Parliament, etc., at the expense of the popular candidates who deliver votes to their parties. It was to prevent the party leaders from resorting to such arbitrary action that the preferential vote system was introduced.",
        "At present, people can decide who should represent them by voting for political parties of their choice first and marking their preferences for candidates. If manape is done away with, the party leaders will have unbridled discretionary power to ensure that only their favourites are returned. Given the sordid manner in which they manipulate the National List by engineering vacancies to smuggle their loyalists into Parliament, how bad the situation will be in the event of the preferential vote being abolished is not difficult to imagine.",
        "That the preferential vote leads to election violence, especially internecine intraparty disputes, is also a big lie propagated by violent characters in the garb of politicians. The JVP has been free from preferential vote battles because its candidates put their party before self. They are worthy of emulation.",
        "The government ought to tread cautiously when introducing electoral reforms. The mixed-member electoral system under which the last local government elections were conducted in 2018 plunged the country into chaos with the number of local councillors doubling to more than 8,000. Now, efforts are being made to change the new system!",
        "The need, in our book, is for the political parties and their leaders to be reformed more than the electoral systems.",

        "Revenues rose by 3% to Rs. 2.2 billion compared with the same period in the previous year, driven by noticeable growth in the wood coatings and paint brushes categories. Profit After Tax (PAT) also demonstrated significant growth, expanding by 77% YoY for the quarter under review to record Rs. 124 million, up from Rs. 70 million in the same quarter of the previous year.",
        "These achievements were driven by steady and growing sales, supported by efficiencies arising from JAT’s acrylic binder and alkyd resin plants coming online earlier in 2024. The Group expects these efficiencies to further support growth and profitability in the coming quarters, with it now producing binders for wood coatings and wall paint emulsions inhouse. This, together with further strengthening of its R&D, Marketing and Bangladesh operations, is expected to have significant positive outcomes for the Group’s balance sheet and financial performance indicators through FY 2024/25.",
        "The quarter under review also witnessed certain significant milestones with regard to JAT’s strategy to expand market share and drive overseas expansion. Accordingly, the Group made its inaugural shipment of wood coatings to Australia, while it also opened showrooms for SEAFORM – the German brand of luxury vanities and kitchens it represents – in both Australia and Bangladesh. During the quarter under review JAT was also able to record 41% growth in project sales, 15% growth in wood coatings including Sayerlack – its flagship wood coating product, and 47% growth in the paint brushes category. JAT Holdings PLC was also honoured at the Green Industry Awards 2024 with a Silver Award for “Sound Chemical Management”, underlining its commitment to sustainability and ecofriendly manufacturing.",
        "CEO Nishal Ferdinando said: “In a quarter where we experienced adverse weather conditions across Sri Lanka, we are proud to have been able to continue to achieve and drive growth in sales and revenue, leveraging our strong brand equity and operational efficiency. It’s also important to note that, while nominal export revenues declined marginally by 6%, on account of exchange rate volatility in the Bangladeshi Taka, our export volumes have remained steady. Thus, we remain firmly on our growth trajectory and will continue to work towards serving our customers and communities, and creating value for our stakeholders.”",
        "JAT Holdings PLC also recorded a 5% growth in gross profits, though growth was subdued by unfavourable exchange rate volatility in the Bangladeshi Taka. However, operating profits contracted by 27%, due to rising overheads as the Group expands its operations in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, profit before tax grew by 37% against the same quarter in the previous year, on account of increased operational efficiencies and favourable movements in the exchange rate of the Sri Lankan Rupee.",
        "JAT Holdings PLC Founder and Managing Director Aelian Gunawardene said: “Relying on strategic decision-making, and leveraging the business acumen of our management team, we have been able to harness efficiencies across our supply chain, particularly in terms of our own acrylic binder and alkyd resin plants now being operational, to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. Furthermore, our heavy investments into marketing and customer loyalty programmes have demonstrably delivered, allowing us to keep sales steady, and even achieve growth, amidst adverse-weather-driven market conditions that generally result in a contraction in sales volumes for the industry. Thus, we remain committed to our growth strategy and to our loyal customers and communities, while also reaffirming our dedication to sustainable manufacturing.”"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the key measures used by organisations to track the success of an organisational interest",
        "KPIs look after the organisation’s growth by revealing its strengths, weaknesses, and sustainability",
        "Organisational leadership designs and establishes KPIs and interprets data gathered through them to make decisions on the success factors of an organisation",
        "This article draws on R&D performance that is measured through KPIs and how those KPI data are used to generate insights for promoting innovations in the commercial agriculture sector in Sri Lanka",
        "Metrics and measuring tools play a pivotal role in evaluating the success of business operations. Among these tools, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) stand out as vital metrics, derived from critical success factors pertinent to an organisation’s core business. Monitoring KPIs is crucial for directing organisational strategies, as they directly influence business outcomes and impacts. However, there are concerns about the effective utilisation of KPIs by Research and Development (R&D) organisations in Sri Lanka.",
        "Doubts linger regarding whether these organisations are efficiently capturing the most significant aspects of their R&D efforts. This raises questions about the optimisation of resources and the alignment of R&D initiatives with overarching business goals. As such, there’s a growing need for these organisations to reevaluate their measurement practices and ensure that KPIs accurately reflect their R&D performance, ultimately enhancing their competitiveness and innovation capabilities on a global scale.",
        "KPIs may be used to gather data that show whether an organisation is growing financially or/and non-financially. Picking the right KPIs and tracking them properly can add value to the R&D business of an organisation in numerous ways.",
        "KPIs clearly illustrate whether or not an organisation is reaching its goals.",
        "It facilitates setting goals, devising a strategy to reach goals, and evaluating performance along the way.",
        "It is a data-driven tool, therefore decisions based on it are transparent and trustworthy",
        "It is a robust tool that can be used even to measure personal performance and strengthen morale.",
        "It can be visually illustrated in many forms as it can be integrated or disintegrated on any focus area of interest.",
        "It is worthwhile to look at a few performance management frameworks in the government organisation at the national level as well as the provincial level. Managing for Development Results (MfDR) is a management strategy for the public sector that places a significant emphasis on how a common vision, specific goals, and effective outcomes assessment may help create a better work process for an organisation. It has specifically emerged as a cornerstone of worldwide efforts around 1999, especially by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to increase the efficacy of public resources and fulfil the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).",
        "Before 2011, the provincial planning and monitoring system paid little attention to the expected results and outcomes, instead focusing primarily on the physical and financial outputs. However, the Finance Commission (FC) of Sri Lanka established some directives in 2011 to make sure that the provinces of the country were being developed equitably. The FC began implementing the Results Based Management (RBM) framework for the provincial planning and monitoring procedures and it was expected to cover many performance areas including development efforts that are specifically emphasised by MfDR. Meantime, The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework was introduced in 2022 to manage national development priorities and achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs in Sri Lanka. All of these frameworks have the common goal of having budgetary and resource allocation.",
        "Also, the effort of using KPIs as a measuring tool in those frameworks was not continuous with the same emphasis except for a few occasions as in the instances instructed by National Budget Circular No. 06 in the year 2015. Subsequently, National Budget Circular No. 06 (I) in the year 2015 issued in 2016 instructed Government organisations to report the progress of KPIs in separate forms quarterly. After that, there were no such strong policy interventions in promoting the reporting of KPIs. However, the practice of KPI was maintained continuously through other means such as annual action plans of government organisations to some extent. Again in early 2023, in reaction to the Cabinet Decision on 20.02.2023, the national planning department recalled the use of ORF (organisational results framework) for each line ministry of Sri Lanka.",
        "However, it is questionable if this core expectation of managing performance has truly been met in the long run due to the ad-hoc nature of practicing these frameworks in government organisations that include government research institutes as well. Although the functionality of the KPIs could not reach its maximum potential as a performance management tool in these instances, it has been able to hold its ground for the last few years to remain as most discussed and deliberated performance measurement tool and has valid ground to remain as potential performance management tool for coming years as well.",
        "Research is a journey with many expectations. Along the way, it has milestones to achieve. By passing all the milestones, it has to accomplish the final goals by strategising the objectives set at the start as exemplified by Figure 1.",
        "Goals, objectives, milestones, and strategies ensure that the research organisation remembers why it has initiated such research and where that research aims to end. KPIs help research organisations to measure their success along the way. Setting and monitoring KPIs informs research leaders about the performance of research conducted in the organisation – where it has fallen short, where it has excelled, and what needs to improve.",
        "In this context, R&D organisations should be cautious about using simple performance measures such as the “number of research programs” as their key performance areas. Such performance measures may be vague in R&D core expectations as those measures may count on mere popularisation activities and simple knowledge creation which is not encouraged in current socio-economic priorities. Instead, in considering the current economic crisis where the government is practicing stringent expenditure measures and investment is staggering in R&D, an R&D organisation can use the “number of commercialised products” as an effective KPI to keep return on investment promoted for allowing the profit reinvestment.",
        "When an R&D institute has a mission of providing useful research output for the national economy as well as society, its strategies are devised to find new ways of R&D efforts to acquire many commercialised products. For this, it has to measure “Unique R&D efforts that reach the commercialisation stage”. Here the goal is to increase the number of R&D efforts that are converted to innovations. This will create a KPI that measures the number of commercialised products. Further, it will attract a new set of R&D efforts to be established in the organisation through organisation strategies, objectives, and targets. Additionally, this KPI may induce the organisation to create some other linked KPIs such as the “number of customers” “number of stakeholders” “number of collaborators”, etc. which increase the potential of those R&D efforts. After the end of each R&D effort, the organisation would assess whether it achieved that goal or objective by analysing the collected data from those KPIs. Decision makers will then determine whether the strategies should be altered or targets to be amended to facilitate their mission that directly impacts the organisation’s vision (See Figure 2).",
        "Set KPIs for R&D in the development of the commercial agriculture sector",
        "The commercial agriculture sector of a developing country like Sri Lanka is at the heart of its economic growth with a contribution of approximately 7% to the GDP of the country last few years. More than 25% of the labour force depends on the success of this sector. The success of the sector depends on productivity which is largely attributed to the success of innovations that come from R&D work. To determine the right KPIs for commercial agriculture development through R&D, a research organisation may ask basic questions about its research output (See Figure 3): What does it add to the commercial agriculture industry? What does it offer to farmers and society at large that other competitors (import industries) don’t? What are the organisation’s financial goals, and how can it convince decision-makers to increase R&D investment? Research organisations may want to target their research for the sector by determining some SMART (specific, measurable, assignable/achievable, realistic, and time-based) objectives by giving much emphasis on key performance drivers such as ‘commercialisation’ and ‘research for society’. Then determine the best KPIs to evaluate them. These KPIs may be digitalised to facilitate a more robust data-driven real-time decision-making system for R&D that focuses on the commercial agriculture sector.",
        "Therefore, in a developing country context research organisation now becomes a business organisation, and that approach is more valid with the economic crisis faced by the country. It’s crucial to outline research values as a business to have a unique vision to measure against and to ensure research organisations are measuring the right aspects of the research performance and satisfying its customers such as farmers, society, and lastly the interest of the nation.",
        "How KPIs assist research institutes to accomplish what society needs",
        "In summary, most of the R&D organisations in Sri Lanka are weak in implementing an R&D strategy that has the necessary clarity, agility, and persuasion to realise national and socio-economic aspirations. In most cases, R&D efforts end up isolated from corporate priorities, disengaged from market developments, and out of sync with the speed of business. Amid a growing gap in performance between those who innovate successfully and those who do not, organisations have become incapable of establishing proper KPIs and maintaining them substantially over their R&D strategy. For example, if a research institute needs to make inventions that can be converted to innovation (marketable product or service), KPI should be set on commercialisation aspects of an R&D effort rather than knowledge creation aspects (See Figure 4).",
        "Currently, there’s a critical oversight within R&D organisations in Sri Lanka, as they struggle to identify and uphold priorities crucial for addressing the prevailing economic crisis faced by the populace. This failure to align strategies with these R&D priorities exacerbates the socio-economic challenges faced by Sri Lankans. However, the potential solution lies in the proper utilisation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). When an organisation accurately focuses on the right KPIs, it enables every team member to grasp the R&D organisation’s performance and its contribution to overall corporate success.",
        "Thus, the establishment and maintenance of KPIs are paramount, ensuring clarity of the company’s vision and guiding everyone on the mission path toward achieving it. This strategic alignment not only fosters organisational cohesion but also empowers individuals to effectively contribute to the company’s overarching objectives and then country’s well-being.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) stressed that the official garment worker minimum wage does not paint an accurate image of the total earnings of a garment worker in Sri Lanka.",
        "Responding to a recent article published on Just-Style, JAAF General Secretary Yohan Lawrence pointed out that the current two-tiered system of a fixed basic wage is complemented by productivity-based payments along with other non-cash benefits.",
        "The Clean Clothes Campaign, the international alliance of labour unions and nongovernmental organisations, claimed that Sri Lanka’s garment industry minimum wage pay scale in general has “failed to cover a worker family’s needs, due to high inflation”.",
        "In March this year, the government increased the national living wage by 40 percent, from Rs.12,500 (US $ 42) to Rs.17,500 (US $ 59) per month, on top of a Rs.3,500 budgetary relief allowance, bringing the total minimum monthly pay to Rs.21,000 (US $ 70). Meanwhile, the apparel sector’s industry-agreed minimum wage, including the government budgetary allowance, stands around Rs.24,000 (US $ 80).",
        "“The article refers to the national minimum wage, which covers the fixed monthly component of employee earnings (the employee’s basic wage). Whilst the national minimum wage was increased after a couple of years, the companies will review the basic wage every year. They will, depending on their ability to pay, increase this basic wage on an annual basis.",
        "The article unfortunately does not make any reference to either the variable components of total earnings (which are paid in cash) or to any of the non-cash benefits afforded to the employees,” Lawrence responded.",
        "The cash benefits include items such as production bonuses, attendance allowances, annual bonuses, skill-based payments and overtime.",
        "“This two-tiered system of a fixed basic wage, complemented by productivity-based payments, has been the norm in all manufacturing industries, both locally and globally,” Lawrence added.",
        "In addition to these cash payments, the industry also provides non-cash benefits such as subsidised meals and transport.",
        "He also noted that several companies also provide subsidised or free dry rations (something that was started at the height of the economic crisis and continues even today) or have other similar schemes to ease the burden of the cost of living on the employees.",
        "Therefore, he argued that it’s unfair to assess the actual level of earnings of the employees merely based on the basic wage.",
        "In addition, Lawrence noted that inflation has come down to single digits since early 2023, after peaking to double digits in 2023, thereby, reducing the inflationary effect on the real wages.",
        "Meanwhile, the JAAF remains confident of reaching US $ 4.5 billion in apparel export earnings this year, despite the challenges."

        "While inflation may have decreased in real terms, stagnant wages and rising taxes have eroded the purchasing power of citizens, exacerbating poverty and inequality",
        "The economic landscape of Sri Lanka has been a subject of fervent debate in recent times, with conflicting narratives surrounding the notion of stability. On the surface, there are indicators suggesting positive growth and progress, yet beneath the veneer lies a stark reality of pervasive instability, particularly for a significant portion of the population.",
        "In a recent episode of Face-the-Nation, a prominent TV broadcast program by News1st, titled “Economic Stability – Myth or Reality,” a panel of esteemed economists and experts delved into the multifaceted nature of Sri Lanka’s economic stability. The panellists included economists Dr. Howard Nicholas, Dhanusha Gihan Pathirana, Institute for Political Economy co-founder Prof. Kanchana N. Ruwanpura, and Advocata Institute CEO Dhananath Fernando. Through their insights, the discussion touched upon critical aspects such as income inequality, inflation dynamics, social welfare measures, trade agreements, and the role of government intervention in managing strategic sectors. This article aims to dissect the key points raised during the program and provide additional analysis of the prevailing economic challenges in Sri Lanka.",
        "Despite optimistic economic indicators touted by the Government, the reality on the ground paints a different picture, one characterised by widespread instability. A substantial portion of the population continues to grapple with financial hardships, unable to afford basic necessities such as energy bills. While inflation may have decreased in real terms, stagnant wages and rising taxes have eroded the purchasing power of citizens, exacerbating poverty and inequality. The burden of servicing public debt has led to cuts in essential services like health and education, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor. Moreover, the precarious state of non-performing loans and bankruptcies among businesses underscores the fragility of the economy, despite superficial signs of growth.",
        "The recent boost in foreign exchange reserves owes more to external factors like remittances and tourism than to sustainable economic reforms, leaving the country vulnerable to future shocks due its continuing balance of payment deficit. As highlighted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), rising income inequality and multidimensional vulnerabilities underscore the urgent need for a more equitable approach to economic stabilisation, with a particular focus on addressing the plight of marginalised groups, including women.",
        "Contrary to popular belief, Government money printing is not the primary driver of inflation in Sri Lanka. This misconception, propagated by global neoliberal think tanks advocating for austerity measures, fails to acknowledge the nuanced factors influencing price levels. Evidence from global central banks, including the US Fed and the Bank of England, attests to the limited role of money supply expansion in inflationary pressures. In reality, inflation stems from a combination of demand-pull and cost-push factors, exacerbated by imported inflation, monopolistic practices, and inflation expectations. Commercial bank deposits issued as debt are the largest supplier of money in countries all around the world. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the domestic credit (rupee money supply) issued by local commercial banks in the last three years were 85.0%%, 80.1% and 85.5% respectively.",
        "While conventional wisdom dictates raising interest rates to curb inflation, such measures often come at the expense of economic growth and employment, disproportionately affecting vulnerable segments of society. Alternatively, progressive taxation policies offer a more equitable means of managing inflationary pressures while ensuring social welfare and economic stability. Moreover, advocating for democratic oversight of the Central Bank is crucial to aligning monetary policy with broader socioeconomic objectives, including full employment and financial system regulation.",
        "The efficacy of targeted cash payments for the poor has come under scrutiny, with evidence suggesting significant shortcomings in reaching intended beneficiaries. Administrative inefficiencies, delays in updating eligibility criteria, and leakage in the distribution process undermine the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, leaving many vulnerable individuals without adequate support. In contrast, energy subsidies offer a more inclusive and immediate form of assistance, benefiting both low-income households and struggling small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, subsidies for public transport alleviate the financial burden on working-class families while promoting sustainable mobility solutions.",
        "However, it is essential to address loopholes that allow for the disproportionate benefit of affluent individuals, such as those driving fuel-inefficient vehicles. Implementing measures to discourage the importation and usage of such vehicles amidst a foreign debt crisis, coupled with incentives for their re-export, can mitigate adverse environmental and economic impacts while bolstering foreign exchange earnings.",
        "Enhancing the effectiveness of social welfare programs is crucial in providing relief to vulnerable segments of society. This entails considering universal benefits, streamlining administrative processes, leveraging technology for targeted delivery, and ensuring adequate funding to meet evolving needs. Moreover, investing in education, healthcare, and social infrastructure is essential for building human capital and reducing inequality in the long term.",
        "Sri Lanka’s approach to trade agreements warrants reconsideration, particularly in light of prevailing economic conditions and developmental priorities. While trade agreements can be mutually beneficial under certain circumstances, entering into unbalanced agreements risks exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining domestic industries. A more cautious and strategic approach to trade policy is necessary, taking into account factors such as technological disparities, labour productivity rates, and the prevalence of precarious employment. Furthermore, the Government must adopt a proactive role in nurturing strategic industrial sectors through targeted interventions and supportive policies. Emulating successful models from other East Asian economies, such as South Korea, entails protecting and promoting local industries until they achieve competitive status on the global stage. This entails fostering a conducive ecosystem for innovation, investment, and skill development, alongside prudent regulation to prevent market distortions and ensure fair competition.",
        "While cautious of unbalanced trade agreements, Sri Lanka must actively pursue trade diversification and market access opportunities for value-added products and services. Prioritising sectors with comparative advantages, such as tourism, IT services, and niche manufacturing, can enhance export competitiveness and reduce reliance on traditional industries based on low-wages. Moreover, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) through a conducive investment climate, transparent regulatory framework, and infrastructure development is critical for stimulating economic growth and creating high-income employment opportunities, that are aligned with strategic sectors.",
        "Addressing gender disparities and promoting social inclusion are integral to achieving sustainable development and economic stability. Investing in education and skills training for women, expanding access to finance and resources, and eliminating discriminatory practices can unlock the untapped potential of half the population. Similarly, empowering marginalised groups, including ethnic minorities, rural communities, and persons with disabilities, requires targeted interventions to address systemic barriers and promote social cohesion.",
        "The notion of economic stability in Sri Lanka appears to be a myth as it is a complex reality shaped by a myriad of socio-economic factors. While there are some signs of progress, the pervasive instability experienced by a majority of the population underscores the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach to economic management that acknowledge structural inequalities. Addressing issues, such as income inequality, inflation dynamics, social welfare provision, trade policy, and industrial strategy requires concerted efforts from policymakers, civil society, and the private sector. By acknowledging the multifaceted nature of economic stability and adopting evidence-based, people-centred policies, Sri Lanka can chart a path towards sustainable development and shared prosperity for all",

      "original_title": "Child’s Guide To Debt & Debt Restructuring: Part III",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Aseni, whiz kid in economics, and her grandfather, Sarath Mahatthaya, an ex-official of the Finance Ministry, are having an interactive dialogue on issues relating to debt and debt restructuring, two topics of immense current interest. They have discussed two matters relating to debt restructuring, total foreign debt and its impact on the country’s indebtedness and the domestic debt optimisation. They continue their discussion.",
        "Aseni: Sri Lanka has increased its foreign borrowing during the post-independence period. For instance, its foreign borrowing at independence in 1948 was a pittance at 4% of GDP. But the total country borrowing at $ 62 billion in December 2023 amounted to 74% of GDP. It is a well-known fact that in ancient times when the country was ruled by Lankan kings, there was no borrowing from abroad to build giant tanks like Parakrama Samudra or pagodas like Rathnamali Maha Seya. How did those kings perform those miracles?",
        "Sarath: One thing was that there was no foreign debt market in the world at that time like today. Therefore, even if those kings desired to borrow from abroad to build those giant infrastructure facilities, they could not do so. But the main reason was their prudent budgetary policy. Unlike the deficit financing which we have today, they had a surplus budgetary policy, following the best practices adopted at that time. Kautilya, the 4th century BCE Indian Guru on economics who wrote the famous text The Arthashastra advised the king to build a treasury because that was the first guard against any adverse shock like a natural disaster locally or foreign invasion from the external side. Kautilya said that “a king with a depleted treasury eats into the very vitality of the citizens and the country”. Therefore, the kings spent less than what they earned as revenue from taxes and profits from government enterprises.",
        "The tax system adopted was inclusive capturing all those who are in society except those temples and villages which had been exempted from taxation. Since agriculture and trade was the main economic activities, farmers and traders were subject to taxation. Kautilya’s economics was faithfully followed by the Lankan kings as revealed in the Chulavamsa, the second part of the Mahavamsa, relating to King Parakramabahu the First. It is said that the king was well versed in the methods of Chanakya who caused the defeat of the Nanda Clan, the real name of Kautilya.",
        "According to Professor Senerat Paranavitana, who wrote the chapter on the tax system in the Polonnaruwa period in the Second volume of the History of Ceylon by the University of Ceylon, the main tax was on land which farmers cultivated through a franchise from the king. The tax was one sixth or 16% of the produce. In addition, every able-bodied man had to work for the king free of charge for three months under a system known as the Rajakari or a compulsory state service system. This is similar to the polls tax which is being charged by the modern governments. It therefore amounted to an income tax of about 25%. Thus, ordinary people had to pay a tax of about 41%, which is very high from modern tax standards.",
        "Since there was a surplus budget, the ancient kings did not have to borrow abroad to finance the giant infrastructure projects like constructing massive irrigation schemes for the people. But the king kept a surplus in the treasury to maintain his power base.",
        "Aseni: I understand it. Then, what was the reason for the post-independence governments to borrow abroad and thereby drive the country to a foreign debt trap?",
        "Sarath: The main reason was the inadequacy of the savings by people as well as the Government to meet the country’s investment requirements.",
        "We can illustrate it by taking an example from an individual. Suppose you earn Rs. 100 a month and you want to buy a car which costs Rs. 1,600. Surely, your income is not sufficient to buy the car. Suppose your consumption expenditure per month is about Rs. 80 meaning that you save Rs. 20 per month. That is because savings is that part of income not consumed. Still, you cannot by the car. But if you wait for 80 months, your savings will be sufficient to buy a car provided the price of cars remain at the same level as today. This is called the savings investment gap. If you borrow now against your future incomes, you can have your car today. But the most important requirement is that you should earn the planned income without disruption to service your loan, that is, to repay the loan and pay interest on your loan. If for some reason your income gets disrupted like you lose your job or the source of income, then, you cannot service your loan. In that case, you run into a situation known as loan default.",
        "Sri Lanka’s past Governments have been notorious spenders, consuming more than they earn. Thus, their savings have been negative, a state known as ‘dissaving’. During 1959 to 2023, the level of dissaving happened to be about 1% of GDP. In the last four years from 2020 to 2023, their consumption has been so high that the level of dissaving happened to be about 6% of GDP. Therefore, the Government has been an eater of private sector savings.",
        "The rule I just mentioned above and applicable to an individual is valid for a country as well. During 1959 to 2023, Sri Lanka’s average annual investments amounted to 24% of GDP, while its national savings amounted to 19% leaving a savings-investment gap of 5%. If the Government had not been a dissaver during this period, the gap would have been a little less by 4% of GDP. If you consider the required investment level of 30% of GDP to make Sri Lanka a rich country within a generation, the savings-investment gap is 11% of GDP which cannot be filled without running into a massive debt flow to the country. Because of this reason, the successive Governments started to borrow abroad to finance the existing savings-investment gap, not the required savings-investment gap.",
        "The problem for Sri Lanka was that the money so borrowed was not reinvested in projects that would generate a sufficient foreign exchange earning to service this debt. In April 2022, the country did not have enough foreign exchange balances to service the debt forcing it to suspend the servicing of loans received from individual countries, called bilateral lenders, and from commercial lenders, mainly those who had invested in the international sovereign bonds or ISBs issued by the Government.",
        "But again, the problem was complicated because the Sri Lanka Government had failed to have a prudent debt management policy after 1983. This was not the case which the country had during the colonial period.",
        "Aseni: You said that during the colonial period the colonial masters had a prudent foreign debt management policy. Can you elaborate on that?",
        "Sarath: Yes, they had a very prudent policy of debt management. A good example is how they managed the foreign debt contracted by the railway authorities. There is a general belief that the railway system was funded out of the moneys extracted from the local population. But it was done by borrowing mostly from the London capital market and later from the local market. When the local colonial government did not have enough funds to construct the Colombo-Kandy railway line, it asked the colonial office in London for permission to borrow £ 1 million from the London capital market. The Colonial Secretary gave the permission under two conditions. One was that the money so borrowed should be used only for the railway project. The other was that the railway authorities should build a sinking fund out of the profits of the railway line to service the debt, namely, payment of interest and the repayment of the principal.",
        "The railway authorities maintained a sinking fund not only for the loan contracted for the Colombo-Kandy railway line but also for all the lines built by them. Accordingly, by 1905 when the whole system had been fully complete, the money in the sinking fund amounted to Rs. 41 million, while the debt liabilities of the railway authorities stood at Rs. 39 million.",
        "This system of maintaining a sinking fund to repay the Government debt was continued by the Sri Lanka Government till 1983. To do so, every year, moneys were allocated from the annual budget to recoup the sinking funds. But in 1983, the finance minister Ronnie de Mel was advised by Treasury officials that there was no need for tying up scarce Government revenue for sinking funds because the Government could always service its debt by further borrowing from foreign and domestic sources. This system is known as the refinancing of the debt service payments. It meant that the Government, instead of earning revenue to service its debt, made further borrowing to do so. That is why the outstanding debt levels increased in absolute terms as well as in relative terms as a percent of GDP.",
        "This strategy seemed to be a plausible one, but its risk is that if the Government is unable to make further borrowing for any reason, it had to use the existing foreign reserves to service the foreign debt. When the reserve levels got depleted, it could no longer service the debt. This was how Sri Lanka had to suspend the servicing of the bilateral and commercial borrowings in April 2022.",
        "Aseni: President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing the Parliament said that foreigners make available those foreign funds by curtailing their consumption. Is there any truth in that statement?",
        "Sarath: Yes, he is correct. If anybody wants to make a saving, he should necessarily cut his consumption and save the excess income. If they do not save, they cannot lend either. What happens is that by curtailing his consumption today and making available the saving to another person, he makes a sacrifice today but allows another person to have a higher consumption. The condition is that the borrower should cut his consumption on a future date and repay the lender. Since the lender is paid interest in addition to the principal amount, what is repaid is higher than the amount lent. In other words, the lender sacrifices his current consumption in preference to a higher consumption tomorrow. If the foreigners do not save and make available those savings to another person by way of a loan, that other person cannot have a higher consumption today.",
        "Therefore, for Sri Lanka to fill its savings-investment gap, there should be someone in another country willing to cut the current consumption, make a saving, and make available that saving in the form of a loan. If Sri Lanka defaults its foreign loans, those savers in other countries will not make their savings available to Sri Lanka. That is why it is crucial for Sri Lanka not to default its foreign borrowing and go for a debt restructuring.",
        "Aseni: Critics had blamed the Government for not getting a haircut or a write-off of the interest or the principal or a mixture of both from the Paris Club members. In answer to the critics, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told the Parliament that it is not the practice of the Paris Club to offer such a facility to a borrower. Is there any truth in this statement?",
        "Sarath: The statement made by President Wickremesinghe is not accurate since there had been instances in which the Paris Club had offered haircuts of varying amounts in the past.",
        "When Latin American countries defaulted their foreign loans in early 1980s, the Paris Club, agreeing to what is now known as Toronto Terms, granted a partial debt forgiveness of 33 1/3% to borrowing countries. Altogether, 20 countries benefitted from this debt relief.",
        "Then in 1991, the Paris Club further increased the loan forgiveness levels to 50% under London Terms. Once again 23 countries benefitted from this loan forgiveness.",
        "A third occasion of loan forgiveness was the increase of the level to 67% in 1994 under Naples Terms. This was offered to heavily indebted poor countries or HIPCs.",
        "Therefore, the Paris Club does not have a hard and fast rule of not granting haircuts to borrowers when their debt is restructured. In that context, the critics are correct and the Ranil Wickremesinghe Government is at fault. What this means is that had Sri Lanka negotiated with Paris Club members vigorously and rigorously, it could have got a sizable haircut. Such a haircut is important for Sri Lanka to reduce its foreign debt levels.",
        "Aseni: Thanks, Grandpa for your excellent elaboration. It also has taught me a good lesson. That is we should not believe politicians without verifying for accuracy what they make as announcements.",

      "original_title": "Learning to lead in academia in London",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Early in my academic career, I understood that excelling in both teaching and publishing was essential for any serious post-secondary educator. While college-level teaching focuses heavily on instruction, universities expect their faculty to also contribute to academic research and publish in respected peer-reviewed journals. This scholarly input is critical for advancing in tenure-track positions, such as Associate Professor and Professor. I realized that my practical experience in hospitality operations and management could significantly enrich my research and publications.",
        "In 1990, I had limited connections with reputable academic journals, so I began by publishing in trade magazines to gain experience. At that time, I had authored only two articles. My first article, ‘Cuisine à la Mosimann’, was published by the Chef Guild of Sri Lanka in their magazine, The Chef. My second article, ‘Internal Sales Promotion’, appeared in the Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association’s magazine, Food & Accommodation. I later used my doctoral research at the University of Surrey to produce a longer article titled ‘Hotel Advertising’, published in the same magazine.",
        "My boss, Professor Richard Kotas, suggested, “Chandi, let’s collaborate on publishing in reputable academic journals and with book publishers in the UK.” This idea planted a seed that grew into a prolific writing career for me, resulting in over 125 refereed journal articles and more than two dozen textbooks over the next 34 years. I owe much of my success in publishing to Professor Kotas, and my second doctoral thesis supervisor, Dr. Richard Teare.",
        "One never knows what opportunities lie ahead. As the Assistant Director of the School of Hotel Management at Schiller International University (SIU), I was thrilled to work under my long-term mentor, Professor Kotas. Having a boss, you respect and like is crucial for job satisfaction. However, one morning, he summoned me to his office and delivered unexpected news: “Chandi, I’ve decided to leave SIU soon. I’ve accepted a good offer from Thames Valley University (formerly Ealing College), which is very close to my home in Acton.”",
        "Sensing my dismay, Professor Kotas reassured me, “I’ve recommended you for the Acting Director position. Chandi, you have proven yourself, and you deserve this promotion.” Later, in recognition of his contributions, the university bestowed upon him the title of Professor Emeritus. His support to me was invaluable, and our friendship lasted over three more decades. My last lunch meeting with him and his wife was at their home in London in early 2020, a few months before he passed away.",
        "In my new role, I reported directly to Dr. Richard Taylor, the Director of the London Campus of SIU. He was a perfect gentleman, and I learned a great deal about academic leadership from him. He was supportive of my suggestions, including structural changes to our office, although we faced challenges due to the historic status of our building. The main building, constructed in 1816, had been awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 1980. I cherished working in such a prestigious building and having an office near Dr. Taylor’s.",
        "The student population at SIU’s London campus was a key strength of our MA in International Hotel and Tourism Management and BBA in Hotel Management programs. During my second semester, our students came from 36 countries across five continents. Our BBA program was particularly unique, offering students the opportunity to study in four campuses in four different countries: the first year in Engleberg, Switzerland; the second year in Strasbourg, France; the third year in London, UK; and a new option of spending the final year in Dunedin, Florida, USA. This global feel was one of the highlights of my career at SIU.",
        "Leveraging my extensive contacts in the British hotel industry, I arranged a series of guest lectures by industry leaders. Living in London provided me a significant advantage for initiating these lectures. I invited friends from Trust House Forte and my former classmates from Le Meridien Management Institute in France, to share their expertise with our students. Additionally, I arranged for Sri Lankan hoteliers working in London, such as Rohan Karr from Mable Arch Marriott, Nihal Sirisena from InterContinental corporate office, and Claire Bostock, to speak to our students. Dr. Taylor appreciated my efforts, saying, “Chandi, you are like a breath of fresh air!”",
        "My early 1980s experience as a Senior Lecturer of the Ceylon Hotel School and teacher training gained on an UNDP/ILO fellowship in Europe helped me tremendously in my new position. Contracting senior British hospitality management educators to teach part-time at SIU presented a challenge due to the differing educational standards between the UK and the American systems we followed at SIU. For example, a 70% score in a British university was considered good, whereas in an American university, it was seen as a below average “C” grade. To address this, I included a special orientation for new part-time British lecturers on the American system to prevent unnecessary student failures.",
        "We utilized excellent educational videos produced by the American Hotel & Motel Association to enhance classroom learning. We also allocated higher budgets for study visits to major events such as the Hotelympia Trade Show, World Travel Mart, Bar and Cocktail competitions, and events organized by the Hotel Catering and Institutional Management Association (HCIMA). Its basing in London allowed our school to fully engage with these opportunities.",
        "During SIU ‘cultural exploration’ dinner at a Mexican restaurant in London, Katia Hekkala, a Swedish student in our BBA program, suggested, “Chandi, why don’t we organize our own event on campus and sell tickets?” Inspired by her idea, we organized a small Cheese & Wine event, which was a success. This led to a larger-scale international party featuring dishes from 36 countries, contributed by students. The success of this event prompted us to repeat it every semester.",
        "The experience I gained at SIU in the early 1990s significantly enhanced my subsequent academic career in the Caribbean and North America.",
        "I strengthened my foundation of professional network in England for the benefit of SIU hotel management students. My involvement as a past student of a few British professional associations such as HCIMA, Hotel and Catering Industry Training Board (HCITB) Wine and Sprit Education Trust (WEST), the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM), opened more doors and allowed us to find additional guest lecturers to enrich our students’ learning experience.",
        "At the 1990 HCIMA Annual General Meeting and annual lunch held in London at the Royal Lancaster Hotel I strengthened existing connections and established new ones. After that we organized a few HCIMA – London Branch events at the SIU campus. During one event, a senior hotelier from Trust House Forte and HCIMA office bearer, Mr. Merryweather, invited me to serve on their committee, stating, “Chandi, you would be an excellent addition to the 2,000-member strong HCIMA – London Branch.” Recognizing the benefits for SIU students, I accepted the invitation without hesitation.",
        "Serving on the HCIMA committee in London taught me valuable lessons in running professional HCIMA chapters, which I later applied in establishing and leading HCIMA chapters in Sri Lanka (in 1991), Jamaica (in 1997), and Ontario, Canada (in 2002). This experience ultimately led to my election as the worldwide President of HCIMA (in 2004).",
        "With a few of my students at the 1990 Hotelympia Trade Exhibition at Earl’s Court, London",
        "In managing a small school within a university, I found that success hinges on being “firm, fair, and friendly.” I encouraged students to address me by my first name and focused heavily on their success. I delivered bonus seminars on career planning and provided tips for establishing global careers. Many of our students achieved remarkable success in the global arena.",
        "Even after 34 years, some of my SIU students from the early 1990s keep in touch with me. Moshi Perera, a Sri Lankan-British student, wrote to me in 2020 when he was appointed General Manager of Shangri-La Hambantota in Sri Lanka: “Thank you, Chandi. I also have lovely memories of a Sri Lankan meal you cooked and served me and two other SIU students at your London home in 1990.”",
        "Zeynep Gürkek, a Turkish student, wrote to me after reading an article I wrote about Vienna in 2022: “Chandi, I now live in Vienna. You must visit us next time you are in Austria!”",
        "Jaana Raisanen, a Finnish student, collaborated with me on projects in Finland, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. A few days ago, she wrote to me on Facebook, “You were, and are, such an inspiration! Your lectures were much appreciated.”",
        "The greatest satisfaction in a career in education is seeing students succeed in their careers and remember their time with you fondly. I feel blessed.",

        "This second edition of the annual event was inaugurated by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism Vijitha Herath in the presence of the Deputy Minister of Industries, Chathuranga Abeysinghe, and Ministry Secretary, Aruni Ranaraja.",
        "Organized by the Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Foreign Service Association (SLFSA) and the Diplomatic Corps, the event presented an array of activities, including international cuisine and Craft Fair, Country Parade, cultural performances, singalong session, raffle draw, and a dedicated Kids’ Corner. The Minister, along with the Deputy Minister of Industries, senior officials, and SLFSA office bearers, visited each stall to engage the participants and attendees.",
        "The evening segment was elevated by the presence of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, who graced the Fashion Show which highlighted sustainability and ethical fashion. Four Sri Lankan designers—Buddhi Batiks, Kelly Felder, Selyn, and Osu Wasthra—showcased their collections. Members of the Diplomatic Corps, including High Commissioners and Ambassadors, modeled sustainable and ethical designs, adding a unique charm to the event.",
        "The Cultural Show further enriched the program, offering a vibrant celebration of global cultures. Traditional and modern music, dance, and performances from Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia provided a tapestry of cultural diversity.",
        "The International Bazaar & Cultural Extravaganza 2024 was conducted with the dual objectives of promoting cultural exchange and raising funds for charity. It will remain a platform for foreign missions based in Colombo to showcase and share their rich heritage through music, art, fashion, and culinary delights while fostering community engagement.",
        "All funds generated from the event is expected to be donated to the M. H. Omar Liver Care Facility at the Colombo North Centre for Liver Diseases, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

      "original_title": "TRUMP SHOOTS FOR PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The case for Presidential Immunity was heard by Washington DC Federal Appeals Court on Tuesday, January 9, where a three-judge panel heard arguments from Trump’s counsel and Special Counsel Jack Smith. A randomly chosen panel, which proved to be misogynist Trump’s worst nightmare: three women, one, the daughter of Asian immigrants (who “poison the blood of the American people”), the second an African American woman and the third, a 79-year-old white woman, not his type at all. A panel of ladies who will be responsible for the most important ruling in a life dripping with every category of criminal behavior.",
        "Trump’s counsel had claimed total immunity for all actions taken by a sitting president, criminal acts which could be construed as critical for the security of the nation, even if such acts were against the law and the Constitution. Trump says he was acting within the scope of his presidential actions during the insurrection of January 6, 2021, because the violence of the attack on the Capitol occurred while he was conducting an investigation into election fraud in the November 2020 election!",
        "When you consider this statement in the context of his pre-insurrection speech at the ellipse, when he exhorted his white supremacist terrorists to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell”, to prevent the peaceful and constitutional transfer of power; when he now refers to these terrorists who have been convicted and serving prison sentences as “hostages”; you realize how emotionally and mentally stunted this seditious lunatic really is.",
        "The main argument of Trump’s counsel suggested that “even a president directing a SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent would be an action barred from prosecution, given a former executive’s broad immunity to criminal prosecution, unless he was first impeached and convicted by Congress”.",
        "Trump’s counsel, John Sauer, seems to be confused by the differences between political and judicial processes. As Senator Mitch McConnell argued, after he voted to acquit Trump after the Congress impeachment for inciting the January 6, 2021 insurrection, “impeachment was never meant to be the final forum for American justice”, adding, “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one”.",
        "As comedian Jimmy Kimmel said, “If a sitting president is legally able to assassinate a political rival without fear of prosecution, Trump had better lock the doors at Mar a Lago because “Bazooka Joe Biden” has every reason to blow it to Kingdom Come”.",
        "The legal concept of Trump’s counsel on presidential immunity is eerily similar to the legal code of Trump’s mentor, Russian President Putin. Putin failed in an attempt to poison Kremlin critic and chief political opponent, Alexei Navalny, who is now languishing in an Arctic penal colony in Siberia, serving a lengthy prison sentence for the vague crimes of “creating an extremist community and financing extremist activities”. Presidential immunity and absence of accountability enable Putin to contest re-election in March this year, with Navalny, who has posed serious threats to his legitimacy, safely out of the way.",
        "An argument also reminiscent of Nixon’s flawed claim in 1974: “If the President does it, it’s legal”. An assertion shot down in flames by the then Supreme Court, which compelled Nixon, after resignation, to seek a presidential pardon from President Ford (which was a part of the deal of his resignation), to avoid future criminal prosecution, which the Supreme Court had deemed to be inevitable without such a pardon.",
        "Which begs the facetious but valid question. Would Donald Trump, a man with a penchant for divorce, have been able to shoot Melania to avoid divorce while he was president, and escape prosecution for murder after he leaves the White House? Grounds for murder? Her resistance to be raped by him, probably because of his renowned noisome body odor and other shortcomings, caused him such mental distress and physical frustration that they prevented him from performing the presidential functions necessary to maintain the nation’s security.",
        "Although there was no legal requirement for Trump to appear at court on Tuesday, he did so willingly, in spite of constant whining that all these court dates interfere with his election campaigns, especially a few days before the Iowa primary.",
        "Trump calculated that his appearance in court will serve him better than a campaign rally speech, as he will be able to get free international publicity by pleading his case for presidential immunity before the world media on the steps of the courthouse. And, of course, even his ridiculous arguments will be lapped up by his “base”, irrespective of judicial inaccuracies, which will enable him, once again, to raise a ton of money from his incredibly gullible supporters.",
        "The ruling of the federal court will be appealed, either to the full Washington DC appellate court, or more likely, the United States Supreme Court. Nothing is certain in the US judicial system, but it is likely that these courts will either refuse to hear the case or throw it out for lack of credible argument.",
        "However, Trump would have won the victory he seeks: to buy more time and gain further delays in the numerous cases against him, to achieve his ultimate and desperate goal to gain re-election in November and so either self-pardon or instruct the Justice Department to dismiss all these cases.",
        "Trump is fully aware that this ruling on presidential immunity is vital if he is to realize his desperate bid for the 2024 presidency. His criminal complicity in and incitement of the January 6, 2021 insurrection would be the easiest of the myriad cases against him to prove conclusively, with video evidence and hundreds of witnesses scheduled to testify against him. As would be the espionage case, where he stole and abused top-secret documents belonging to the government when he was ejected from the White House. Both criminal cases which, if he is convicted, will see him in prison for the rest of his miserable life.",
        "Trump is facing another unexpected threat to his hitherto certain nomination to the Republican candidacy in November. Last week, Nikki Haley had a surge in the New Hampshire polls and is now within seven points of Trump’s numbers, 39% to 32%, the closest any rival has ever been to him in the polls during this election cycle.",
        "Chris Christie unexpectedly suspended his campaign last week, with a defiant and courageous speech. The only Republican who had openly and virulently attacked Trump, he concluded his speech with a veiled shot at Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, and those Republicans who feel that they have no other choice than a convicted felon as their candidate for the presidency.",
        "“Anyone who is unwilling to say that Trump is unfit to be president of the United States is unfit themselves (to be president of the United States)”.",
        "Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis squared off at the CNN sponsored debate, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, last Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa. The debate provided them with their last chance before the Iowa primary on Monday, January 15, to win over Iowa voters, and emerge as an admittedly long-shot alternative to Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee in November 2024.",
        "Donald Trump was also invited to participate in the debate, but he declined, as he has done in all previous Republican debates. Instead, he attended an hour-long Fox News town hall meeting in Iowa on the same night, moderated by Fox anchors, Brett Baier and Martha MacCallum. Trump was talking to a captive audience, ranting the usual drivel about his stable genius, though he did try to talk down some of the more outrageous comments he has made in recent weeks. He said “I am not going to be a dictator”, and said he “wouldn’t have time for retribution”, because he’ll be too busy Making America Great Again. Predictably, he boasted about his enormous lead in the Republican polls and had the usual crude words of insult for his rivals. There seems to be little doubt that he would be the Republican nominee in November 2024, unless there is a legal implosion which will prevent him from contesting the election.",
        "So the real choice for both Haley and DeSantis at the CNN debate was whether to rip into each other, go after Trump with their gloves off, or both. So far, they had been just playing for second place, notably Nikki Haley, who had remained, until this debate, very coy about being selected for Trump’s Vice President spot. Trump dangled this bait during the Fox News town hall meeting, when he said that he had already made his VP choice, but refused to name the person.",
        "Predictably, Haley and DeSantis chose mainly to stay with the first alternative, attacking each other for much of the debate. They did briefly dance around the second, getting in a few telling shots against Trump, the front runner by far for the nomination.",
        "They both agreed that Trump should be participating in the debate, to defend his record. But they refused to be specific, saying nothing about his performance during his first term of presidency, when he mismanaged the pandemic which cost over 600,000 avoidable deaths, and added $7.8 trillion to the national debt; and the 91 felonies on which he has been arrested after his defeat in November 2020. Felonies of sedition, inciting an insurrection to prevent the constitutional transfer of power, and espionage, stealing and dealing in top-secret documents belonging to the government, to name just two.",
        "And they failed a perfect opportunity of going after Trump, when Jake Tapper asked them both the easiest softball question, one begging to be hit out of the park.",
        "Tapper’s question: Did they believe that Donald Trump has the moral character to be president again?",
        "Nikki Haley waffled: “I think Trump was the right president at the right time. But I think the president needs to have moral clarity….I believe in getting things done, no vendettas, no whining, just getting things done. I think it’s time for a new generational leader that’s going to go and make America proud again, and that’s what I’m trying to do”.",
        "Same question for DeSantis, who was a little tougher on Trump, criticizing his poor record on curbing public disorder, specifically during the Black Lives Matter riots after the brutal murder of George Floyd in 2020, broken promises on the border wall and failure to attack Washington corruption.",
        "But if they had the slightest intention of challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, there was really only one correct answer to Tapper’s question.",
        "Wednesday’s debate was a weak dead-heat for second place, with Haley and DeSantis limping to the finish line, the winner again being the non-participating Trump. The murky Republican nomination clouds may become a little clearer after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries next week and January 23, respectively.",
        "Judging on Wednesday’s performance, Trump will win Monday’s Iowa primary in a hack canter, with Nikki Hayley plugging along to a distant second. And the New Hampshire primary on January 23 will see Trump conclusively clinch the Republican nomination.",

        "The Steering Committee said it is made of funds managed or advised by Amundi Asset Management, Barings LLC, BlackRock and its subsidiaries, Eaton Vance Management, Fidelity International, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. LLC, HBK Capital Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Neuberger Berman, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., and Wellington Management.",
        "“The Steering Committee encourages all holders of Sri Lanka’s international bonds to review the documentation published by Sri Lanka today, note the respective instructions and deadlines embedded in the Invitation, and participate in the exchange as early as possible,” a statement said.",
        "“They believe that the successful completion of the transactions contemplated by the Invitation and the debt relief provided under the restructuring terms will make a substantial contribution to ensuring the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s external debt in the medium term, paving the way for the country to achieve strong, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth.”",
        "The committee negotiated bonds, whose principal and interest go up if GDP grows faster than expected.",
        "Sri Lanka has generally grown at rates of around 5 percent a year including during a 30-year war, unless macro-economists denied monetary stability by suppressing rates with inflationary liquidity operations.",
        "Steering Committee of Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders announces support for Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring terms",
        "The Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders (the “Ad Hoc Group” or the “Steering Committee”) is pleased to announce its support for the restructuring terms of all 11 series of Sri Lanka’s c.$12.55 billion in outstanding sovereign bonds, as detailed in the Republic of Sri Lanka’s Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum (the “Invitation”) published today.",
        "The Ad Hoc Group represents a diverse and significant cross-section of international holders of Sri Lanka’s sovereign bonds, collectively holding approximately 40% of Sri Lanka’s total outstanding sovereign bonds.  The Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group includes, among others, funds and/or accounts managed or advised by Amundi Asset Management, Barings LLC, BlackRock and its subsidiaries, Eaton Vance Management, Fidelity International, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. LLC, HBK Capital Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Neuberger Berman, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., and Wellington Management. The Ad Hoc Group is advised by White & Case LLP as its legal counsel, and Rothschild & Co. as financial advisor.",
        "In the two and a half years following Sri Lanka’s default in 2022, the Ad Hoc Group has engaged in constructive dialogue with the Sri Lankan authorities to define the terms of a bond restructuring aimed at returning the country to the path of debt sustainability and ensuring fair and balanced treatment of bondholders.  The Ad Hoc Group has also cooperated with the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka (“LCSL”), which is understood to consist of 11 members and controls approximately 12% of Sri Lanka’s outstanding sovereign bonds, to seek a comprehensive and joint solution for Sri Lanka. Together, the Ad Hoc Group and the LCSL members represent over 50% of the total outstanding amount of Sri Lanka’s sovereign bonds.",
        "This dialogue led to the Agreement in Principle (the “AIP”) on the core terms of the sovereign bond restructuring announced on September 19, 2024, reached with both the Ad Hoc Group and the LCSL. The IMF has subsequently confirmed that the terms are consistent with the debt targets and other key parameters of Sri Lanka’s IMF-supported program, and Sri Lanka’s Official Creditor Committee confirmed that the terms meet the comparability of treatment principle.",
        "Early in the negotiations, the Steering Committee introduced two new instruments – Macro-Linked Bonds (MLBs) and Governance-Linked Bonds (GLBs) – whose payouts are linked, respectively, to the economic performance of Sri Lanka during the IMF program period and the achievement by Sri Lanka of certain concrete governance objectives. The Steering Committee is pleased that these innovative instruments have been included as key pillars of the restructuring solution reflected in the Invitation.",
        "Since the announcement of the AIP, the Steering Committee and its advisors have worked collaboratively with the Sri Lankan government and its advisory team to refine the terms of the new securities to be offered to bondholders as part of the Invitation, whilst maintaining close cooperation with the LCSL.",
        "The Steering Committee strongly supports the terms of the bond restructuring outlined in today’s Invitation, which reflect the key legal and financial terms outlined in the AIP. Members of the Steering Committee confirm their intention to participate in the Invitiation by tendering their outstanding bonds and providing their consents. They believe that the successful completion of the transactions contemplated by the Invitation and the debt relief provided under the restructuring terms will make a substantial contribution to ensuring the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s external debt in the medium term, paving the way for the country to achieve strong, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth.",
        "The Steering Committee encourages all holders of Sri Lanka’s international bonds to review the documentation published by Sri Lanka today, note the respective instructions and deadlines embedded in the Invitation, and participate in the exchange as early as possible."

      "original_title": "Trump 2.0 – What it means for Sri Lanka’s exports",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "The second term of Donald Trump as the President of the United States will begin on January 20, 2025. He will return to the White House for his second term, or Trump 2.0, with renewed emphasis on the “America First” doctrine and reshaping the global order, and both his supporters and critics have made clear that his second term will look nothing like the first. That means, Trump 2.0 will be even more volatile and disruptive than the first, with major changes in the US economic, trade, foreign and security policies with far-reaching implications for all countries. So, it is important and timely to ask what will be the impact of Trump 2.0 on Sri Lanka and plan how to respond to challenges and opportunities that would arise from those changes.",
        "Here, the first and foremost area Sri Lanka should immediately focus on is the impending changes to the US trade and tariff policy. Sri Lanka, which accounts for 0.1% of the total US imports will certainly not be a priority in President Trump’s trade policy agenda. But Sri Lanka should consider the ongoing changes in the trade policy of the United States as the top priority because that market accounts for nearly a quarter of Sri Lanka’s total exports. Any major changes in the US trade policy, particularly tariff increases, will have an immediate and far-reaching impact on our exports, the GDP and export related jobs.",
        "While on the campaign trail, Trump called himself a “Tariff Man,” and had promised to raise tariffs to 60% for all goods imported from China and to 10% to 20% for those imported from other countries. This he argues, would strengthen the US’s international trade position and boost US job growth. Then he had also promised to, “….  as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States…. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”",
        "Mexico, China and Canada, with market shares of 15.1%, 14.1% and 13,6% respectively, are the three largest exporters into the United States. The European Union has a market share of 18.6%. With over 60% of the market share. In 2023 exports to the United States from Mexico were valued at $ 480 billion and from China were valued at $ 448 billion. When compared to these main exporters to the United States, Sri Lanka is a very small player. In 2023 our exports to the USA were valued at US$ 2.9 billion which amounted to 0.1% of total imports by the United States.",
        "Right after the declaration of the election results, addressing a triumphant crowd of supporters in Florida, Trump summed up his approach to a second term as such: “I will govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept.” So, will he keep these promises? And what would be the impact of these high tariffs on Sri Lanka? Though past performance is not a reliable guide to the future, the answers to some extent we may find in his previous presidency, Trump 1.0.",
        "During his last presidential term (2017 -20) President Trump did not implement all his campaign promises. But what was implemented created uncertainty and volatility in the global markets. Most importantly in January 2018, the first Trump administration began setting higher tariffs (ranging from 7.5% to 25%) on a number of Chinese imports into the US with the objective of forcing China to change “longstanding unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft.” Prior to that, China, like all other members of the WTO, was entitled for MFN (Most Favoured Nation) tariffs in the United States. China joined the WTO in 2001, after 14 years of bilateral and multilateral negotiations, first under the auspices of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and later under the WTO (World Trade Organisation). During the lengthy accession process one of the key steps was the signing of the US-China bilateral agreement which is generally considered the core of the accession agreement. The China specific higher tariffs imposed by Trump1.0 were above the prevailing MFN tariffs. In response, the Chinese government accused the US of engaging in protectionism and took retaliatory action, setting off a trade war between the two countries. After the trade war escalated through 2019, in January 2020 the two sides reached a “phase-one” agreement. During the Trump 1.0, the United States also pressured Canada and Mexico to negotiate a new trade agreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) replacing the quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under NAFTA and the USMCA Mexico and Canada get reciprocal duty-free market access into the United States.",
        "During that period almost all Asian countries benefited significantly as the manufacturers shifted their production facilities in China into the countries in the region to avoid Trump’s tariff hikes. As a result, the region’s exports to the US had increased steadily since the beginning of the trade war. Vietnam’s exports to the US more than doubled from US$48 billion in 2017 to US$ 118 billion by 2023. Thailand’s exports increased from US$32 billion to US$ 58 billion and India’s exports increased from US$ 50 billion to US$87 billion.",
        "Unfortunately, during Trump 1.0, Sri Lanka was the only Asian country that failed to benefit from the diversification of sourcing away from China into other Asian countries. Sri Lanka’s exports to the US declined during that period from US$ 2.978 billion in 2017 to US$ 2.976 billion by 2023.",
        "Notwithstanding all these agreements signed with China, Mexico and Canada President Trump has now promised to introduce a 60% tariff on all imports from China and has vowed to apply higher 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico! In addition, he has also promised to introduce a 10% to 20% tariff on all other countries. Will these tariff hikes be fully implemented or are these threats simply “useful negotiating tool”?",
        "Given the unpredictable style in which President Trump operates, it is difficult to predict which of the campaign promises will really be fully implemented. But we can certainly anticipate an all new U.S. tariff regime in 2025. Most probably, it will be something less than a blanket tariff hike, with significant carve outs for FTA (free trade agreement) partners and essential goods, but still be much higher than what we have now. Higher tariffs on most Chinese goods will certainly arrive early. With higher import tariffs being imposed by the US and possible retaliatory actions by other countries, it’s really difficult to guess as to how the tit-for-tat game ends. But the year 2025, will be remembered as a year of a major trade war between the world’s largest trading nations and market instability.",
        "When higher tariffs are introduced by the United States there will be risks and opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters. Most of our exports to the US already pay a high tariff of over 10%. Even if across the board a 10% to 20% tariff is introduced it will not have a major impact on those exports. Other exports with lower tariffs, like tea and rubber products, may face some market access issues. But, overall impact will be favourable to Sri Lanka. If we plan and strategize correctly and intervene pro-actively Sri Lanka could benefit from the anticipated changes in the US trade policy. But it is important to remember that Sri Lanka was the only Asian country that failed to benefit from the China specific tariff hikes during Trump 1.0. So, this is not the time for a “wait-and-see” approach.",
        "As the anticipated changes, had been well signalled much in advance, relevant government agencies, Sri Lankan businesses exporting to the US and the trade associations (AmCham–Sri Lanka and the Joint Apparel Association Forum – JAAF) should do everything they can to moderate the adverse effects and to benefit from possible trade and investment diversions. This is essential as the US importers have already shifted at least some of their orders for 2025 away from China and Mexico to minimize the possible adverse impact of very high tariffs anticipated from January 20th. The recent “slow surge in orders” received by Sri Lankan apparel exporters as well as the recent investment by an American engineering technology group at Wathupitiwala, could have resulted from this discreet shift of sourcing.",
        "Why did Sri Lanka fail to attract any noteworthy US investment relocated from China during and since the last Trump administration? Can we reverse that now and start to benefit from American customers’ demand to diversify supply chains? It is possible to find the answers to these two questions in the speech made by  the US Ambassador Julie Chung at the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new American factory at Wathupitiwala, last October, where she stated,  “SHIELD’s decision to shift its facility in China to establish a manufacturing facility here in Sri Lanka is a testament to the growing interest of US investment in Sri Lanka….Manufacturing moves like this one, driven by customer demand to diversify supply chains, represent a great opportunity for Sri Lanka. If the new government can strengthen the investment climate, implement anti-corruption measures, and strengthen business-friendly governance and transparency, there is potential for even more manufacturers to make similar moves.”",

        "Piyum Hasthika alias “Piyuma”, who is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias “Kudu Salindu,” was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE on February 15, 2024.",
        "Subsequently, the CID secured detention orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to interrogate the suspect.",
        "According to Sri Lanka Police, “Piyuma” was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months.",
        "He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North.

        "Palestinian Red Crescent personnel check an ambulance destroyed by Israeli attacks in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip yesterday. AFP",
        "Sri Lanka, whose economic independence has been severely undermined due to its economic bankruptcy, has little freedom or external sovereignty to take a principled stance concerning the Palestinian cause.",
        "States are expected to be law-abiding and uphold global justice. They must desist from committing crimes against humanity or being complicit in crimes against humanity. But in practice, most states act like ruffians, showing scant respect for the laws of warfare and international humanitarian laws.",
        "In Gaza, international laws and international humanitarian laws are being violated with such impunity that one wonders whether genocide is the new norm in dealing with international disputes. What is worse, the United States, the so-called champion of a rules-based international order, has become the biggest accomplice in Israel’s genocide in Gaza, as it blankly refuses to even make a mild request to Israel calling for a ceasefire. One may say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the United States to enter the morality-based political sphere.",
        "Not only does the US adopt a morally reprehensible policy that has encouraged Israel’s genocide in Gaza, but it is also known to pressurise less powerful states to toe its pro-Israeli line. A case in point was its efforts to arm-twist several nations ahead of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, which partitioned Palestine in 1947. The resolution would not have found its passage if the US had not exerted undue economic threats and political pressure on countries such as Haiti, Liberia, and the Philippines, which wanted to vote against the resolution.",
        "Sri Lanka is under pressure from the US to abandon the Palestinian cause it has been championing since independence, especially during the heydays of the Non-Aligned Movement. Also adding pressure on Sri Lanka is, it is believed, India, which has embraced Israel with warts, war crimes, and all.",
        "This was evident in President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s speech to the UN General Assembly last year. He desisted from making a declaration supporting the Palestinians’ aspiration for freedom, thus veering away from the tradition almost all Sri Lankan leaders had followed.",
        "In Sri Lanka’s post-independence political history, two leaders stand out for defying US pressure: Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Ranasinghe Premadasa. Ms. Bandaranaike’s pro-Palestinian policy was so solid that she became a household name in the Middle East. It was her pro-Palestinian policy that opened the Middle Eastern job market to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is indebted to Ms. Bandaranaike for every dollar it earns from remittances from the Middle East.",
        "Mr. Premadasa was also a courageous leader who did not bend in two to appease the US. When the 1991 UN General Assembly resolution 46/86 was sponsored by the US to nullify the 1975 resolution 3379, which rightly equated Zionism with racism, Washington sought Sri Lanka’s support. The then-US ambassador conveyed to Mr. Premadasa that President George H.W. Bush would like to speak to him. Mr. Premadasa, sources privy to the incident say, told the ambassador to tell his president not to waste his time. Referring to Sri Lanka’s Muslims, Mr. Premadasa said he had a responsibility to a section of his constituency whose aspirations he was duty-bound to fulfil. This was at a time when Mr. Premadasa depended on US quotas for his ambitious 200-garment factory programme.",
        "On Mr. Premadasa’s instructions, Sri Lanka voted against the US-sponsored resolution, becoming the only non-Islamic and non-communist nation to do so. A year later, the US asked Sri Lanka for overflight permission for its warplanes that were being relocated from the Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines to the Middle East. Mr. Premadasa agreed, and the decision was also overwhelmingly supported by the United National Party’s Muslim ministers, parliamentarians, and local council members.",
        "That was a time when Sri Lanka enjoyed freedom in foreign policy-making. Mr. Wickremesinghe was a prominent member of Mr. Premadasa’s cabinet. Though he stood by Mr. Premadasa during the impeachment crisis in 1991, he does not seem to have learned the then-president’s foreign policy-making art that incorporated principles and the aspirations of his constituency.",
        "No wonder Mr. Wickremesinghe is taking a foolhardy decision to deploy Sri Lanka’s naval forces in the Red Sea to protect international navigation from attacks from Yemen’s Houthi forces. True, it is unlawful under international law to attack international merchant ships. But the Houthi action needs to be seen in the wider context of Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza.",
        "The Houthis decided to attack ships destined for and owned by Israel to pressure Israel to stop its genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people after they found all efforts short of a military option had failed to stop it. So, as far as the motive is concerned, the Houthis’ action is virtuous.",
        "Moreover, in terms of relative moralism, right or wrong depends on the specific circumstances of the situation, and moral judgments cannot be made without considering the context.",
        "The Houthis may be right or wrong, but why is Sri Lanka getting involved in a conflict that could turn into a major regional war? Its argument that the Red Sea crisis is inimical to Sri Lanka’s economy is fragile. Most war situations hurt vulnerable economies like Sri Lanka. Does it mean we need to get militarily involved in every theatre to undo the harm?",
        "Besides, Sri Lanka does not have the type of naval craft capable of patrolling seas thousands of miles away from the country’s shores. Also, whatever vessels Sri Lanka deploys could become sitting ducks for Houthi drones and missiles unless our vessels get air cover from US fighter jets.",
        "The government is putting Sri Lankan sailors in harm’s way, and going by the UN Security Council resolution adopted on Wednesday, the Red Sea situation is likely to aggravate into a major regional or global conflict. The US-sponsored resolution, among other things, encourages Member States to “support capacity-building efforts” of the Yemeni coastguard to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the country.",
        "Analysing the resolution’s text reveals a potentially dangerous situation unfolding. It could mean the relative peace in Yemen after 12 years of war will soon be shattered with the US-led coalition getting involved in the Yemeni war to reverse the war gains of the Houthis, who are the de facto rulers of Yemen.",
        "The resolution is more than protecting navigation in the Red Sea; it is a US attempt to protect Israel’s economy, which is being dealt a devastating blow by Houthi attacks on ships linked to Israel. If Sri Lanka were to join the US-led coalition, it would imply the government’s support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, however much it defends its position by pointing out its UN General Assembly vote in support of a Gaza ceasefire. The moral question for Sri Lanka is: What is Sri Lanka doing to stop the genocide in Gaza?"

        "In trying times, it is theatre’s duty – and its privilege – to step up to the plate, where other actors in civil society have dropped the ball in terms of finding an alternative to our much needed ‘right of recall’",
        "For a while now, it would seem English-Language Theatre (ELT) in Sri Lanka has neglected its greater potential as a vehicle to engage critically with civics and government in the larger national interest.",
        "When this writer – then an arts editor – first proposed a consortium of the creative and critical arms of ELT in 1994, there were few takers (and even fewer now) for a role in which theatre dares speak truth to power.",
        "This it would do after talking (on- and off-stage) amongst its producers, players and paying members of the public – a coalition of civil society against crime, corruption and crooked politics.",
        "Many valuable and valiant attempts were made – from politically-angled dramatisations of Shakespeare, George Orwell and Dario Fo, to original scripts such as Jehan Aloysius’ “Rag” which exhilaratingly addressed the bane of varsity hazing as an evil to be eradicated.",
        "There have been less sensitive attempts such slapstick passed off as satire, stand-up comedy that is ‘caviar to the general’ (meaning tasteless morsels for the masses as the Bard of Avon meant it) and even, ahem, musicals in all their theatrical glory that missed the opportunity to make a statement.",
        "However these fell short of the mark because they sought more to please those whom they considered their true audiences – cast and crew, and families and friends and fans – rather than critically engage the powers that be with serious content.",
        "In trying times, it is theatre’s duty – and its privilege – to step up to the plate, where other actors in civil society have dropped the ball in terms of finding an alternative to our much needed ‘right of recall’ (a legitimate constitutional mechanism) whereby we retard the chicanery of our elected representatives when they don’t deliver on manifesto and election promises.",
        "ELT’s Sinhala counterpart, which is far more subversive and serious about their stagecraft, remains marginal to Colombo audiences and peripheral to the City’s consciousness in that it hardly speaks to finance, economy and business power centres.",
        "If paternalism, the patriarchy and patron-client cocktails circuits want a circus, they have the real thing in their political intrigues anyway, right?",
        "Meanwhile, English-speaking impresarios covering the ‘Colombo 7’ (and ‘3’ and ‘5’) circuit – the affluent coffee-morning matriarchy and influential yuppies, as well as irritating yobbos and indolent yahoos – are more mindful about making a splash with amusements and entertainments.",
        "Sadly, they’re also making a handful of shekels where feasible (admittedly rare in these post-debt-defaulting days and quite forgivable even in a pre-bankruptcy ethic), rather than making a change to the often abysmal status quo on the socio-political economic scenes that cries out for critical engagement ahead of any",
        "In a new year ahead, we hope for a sea-change into something rich and strange: a milieu in which mindful thespians through meaningful drama shore up for posterity rather than popularity.",
        "Let’s continue to look at the possibilities in this regard held out by the re-run of a play that went on the boards in November 2024 and saw Feroze Kamardeen (FK) reprise the eponymous role last weekend at the Wendt.",
        "NOTE: this analysis and commentary is based on the original script as it first took shape in FK’s febrile brain; and therefore, may differ from successive theatre performances – after all, it’s “ad libitum” (‘at the performer’s pleasure’), though not necessarily at the audience’s!",
        "Grow Up Nana (GUN) – no comma, no exclamation! – was a satirical exploration of the Sri Lankan Muslim (SLM) community undertaken by the dynamo behind (and in this case, up in front of the footlights of) StageLight&Magic, that other SLM.",
        "Nana is in funereal – yet funny – mood as we find him today:",
        "“What is the difference between a rich Muslim man’s funeral and a poor Muslim man’s funeral? The rich man’s funeral might leave more widows. But you have to admit: better to leave widows and legitimate children than leave mistresses and fatherless children. Widows have their dignity; widows have their rightful share of the inheritance; and if or when they get remarried, they don’t have to go through the whole business of changing their name, again, because they keep their father’s name for life! Just to be clear – Islam does allow polygamy; but what most people may not know is that it is under very strict rules, the most important one being that all the wives must be treated equally, emotionally, financially and sexually. Yes, it specifies that you must be able to do that. It’s not for every Tom, Dick and Harry. Or in this case: Tuan, Dilshan and Hashan.”",
        "It is this studied interweaving of the general into the particular that gives one hope there is a future for both satire and stand-up comedy as tools for social change undertaken by critically engaging societal issues in jocular mode. It is by extrapolating ethnic peculiarities that the larger fabric of society may be given a ‘golden thread’ to ‘wind it into a ball’.",
        "On the Public Display of Wealth (PDW) front, Nana takes a sly dig at all communities by addressing ‘you guys’ – i.e. the ethnic others – in the audience: “If you want to show off your wealth, you guys can serve Red Label, show the world you are rich. Super-rich, you can serve black label. Ultra-rich, you can serve Chivas or single malt and have a champagne tower, stack up the glasses like the Eiffel Tower and pour Crystal over it. What can we do? Pour a mega-bottle of Faluda? We can’t!”",
        "In similar vein he attacks the wastefulness of showing off at weddings that are commonplace with our society’s parvenus and Colombo’s ubiquitous nouveau-riche: “Even with food, you guys have so many options. Rich, you can serve a buffet with an action station. Super-rich, you can have three stations and sushi. Ultra-rich, you can serve anything from lobster to caviar to Kobe beef! What are our options? Rich, we serve good buriyani; super-rich, we serve better buriyani; ultra-rich, best buriyani. But it’s still buriyani, no? Can’t put caviar or lobster on top of that... no way!”",
        "While on the subject of food and drink, Nana critiques the so-called ‘eating-drinking Muslims’ who may well imbibe but never ever eat pork. Going the whole hog, Nana confesses to having once been guilty of tasting the bitter cup not of paradise but à la ‘podara’ Muslims, and claims he is clean now. By being humorous about pious SLMs who say their ‘bismis’ – “bismillah hirrahman nirraheem” (‘in the name of almighty Allah the most beneficent, the most merciful’) faithfully even before taking a surreptitious sip of the cup that cheers, FK is able to expose the hypocrisy as well as emptiness of conventional religious traditions. Would that other fundamentalisms could face their",
        "Ethnic labelling – even and especially internecine rivalries – are ridiculed in the name of a higher SLM unity.",
        "Says Nana: “When it comes to labelling ourselves, we Sri Lankan Muslims are in a league of our own. No other community puts so many labels on themselves. We are roughly two million people in this country and we have Moor, Memon, Borah, Bhai, Malay, Thakkiya party, Galle Fort party, Thablik Jamaath, Tawheed Jamaath, Kandiri party, Awliya party, Uppu party, Waral aata-er party, Thakbir katta-er party, Bawrula Thakbir, Nenjila Thakbir, Kalathala Thakbir. You name it we put a label",
        "Shall we mention the remarkable parallels between this labyrinthine partisanship and the morass of middle-class ethno-religious virtues and social mores among Sri Lanka’s melting-pot classists?",
        "“Borah, Bhai, Memon, Moor, Malay, we divide ourselves nicely so we can become superior to someone else. In addition to being adorably racist, we are also unashamedly placist. Colombo Muslims look down on Galle Muslims, who look down on Colombo Muslims AND Kandy Muslims, who look down on Gampola Muslims, and EVERYONE looks down on Batticaloa Muslims. Even in Galle, they divide themselves as Galle Muslims and Galle Fort Muslims. Galle Fort Muslims get along with the Colombo Muslims but they are looked down by the Kandy Muslims because apparently their ancestors flirted too much with the Portuguese. They are quite fair, actually – the Portuguese AND the Galle Fort Muslims.”",
        "Sri Lankans of other ilk have similar placisms, don’t they? ‘I am a southerner’ or ‘We are not Kandyans but GSB all the same’ and even ‘The KSD castes are far more entrepreneurial than...’",
        "Nana addresses the innate ‘placism’ of SLMs to make a larger point about the insular ethnic pettiness that runs the gamut across our island-nation’s diverse and divergent communities:",
        "“The Kalmunai Muslims look down on the Akkaraipattu Muslims because they are not educated enough. Sammanthurai Muslims don’t like the Mardamuna [Maruthamunai] Muslims because they are not rich enough. Nindoor [Nintavur] Muslims don’t marry their girls off to boys from Nappatimunna [Natpaddimunai] and the Attalachena [Addalaichenai] Muslims don’t marry their boys off to Oluvil Muslims – all within the same province! At least, the rest of the Muslims practise their placism across the country. In the East, it’s a concentrated local operation. Can’t blame them…”",
        "It is not so ‘local’ that other similarly much-segmented communities based on caste and creed can’t relate, no?",
        "“Let’s face it – most of my fellow countrymen, when given the choice of unity versus anything else (and I mean, literally anything else, I can confidently say) will choose anything else. If it was a choice between a rotten sandwich with spoilt jam and unity, some of us will go: ‘What flavour was that jam?’ And before anyone gets triggered, remember: ‘83 weren’t the only riots we had and the LTTE weren’t the only armed civil insurrection we had.”",
        "Let me also say, before anyone reading all of this ‘gets triggered’, that there’s much food for thought here… and for more than ‘eating-drinking Muslims’ at that! #NuffSaid",
        "Nana says it better: “Our myth of unity is only superseded by our myth of superiority over our neighbours.”",
        "Did he mean Sri Lankan Muslims in particular or Sri Lankans in general? Even if you’ve never before thought of your own community as being such one-upmanship-loving beings, please consider it now – in print, being spared the (hefty) price of admission for GUN or its reprise.",
        "But speaking about ‘food for thought’ – there are things to be learned about watalappam you never dreamed of in your philosophy, Horatio (or Haroun or Haramanis or Hariharan)!",
        "“If you are ever having a function and you are inviting Muslims friends, do not under any circumstances serve watalappam for dessert. Because you can get it from the best kitchen in this country, you can get Adriano Zumbo to make it – but to every SLM, that watalappam is like cream caramel with jaggery. Every SLM has already eaten the best watalappam in the world: mummy’s.”",
        "Nana has tasted sugar and he’s hitting that sweet spot between sarcasm and subversion:",
        "“You guys think watalappam is watalappam? There are many different criteria used to judge the watalappam. The colour, which must be dark but not black; the right amount of spices; quantity and mix has not changed for generations – no need to be progressive! That’s why you don’t get ‘cinnamon watalappam’ or ‘cardamom watalappam’ or ‘vanilla watalappam’! Watalappam is watalappam, no variations required.”",
        "Trust you gourmets and gourmands alike – to say nothing of critics with an appetite for government-bashing – are taking this all down...",
        "“It must have the right number of holes; the top cannot be smooth; it must have some peaks and valleys; when you scoop out the watalappam it must leave a little juice at the bottom of the dish; it must be a little firm on top and slightly less so at the bottom, and the colour too must vary ever so slightly. It’s a complex dish to get right.”",
        "So is satire. So is stand-up comedy. So is subversion of sacred cows. So is speaking truth to power. So is standing up for what you believe in as well as what is best for yourself and your neighbour – after you’ve taken a long, hard, clear, unbiased, critical and charitable view of your own household, where societal judgment must start.",
        "Speaking of which: no FK farce or festively slapsticky play is complete without a stab at politics!",
        "Again, let Nana speak for himself. However, that would be in the third and final instalment of this review of the role of ethnics in shaping society through speaking truth to power in theatre."

        "We as a nation know how our country’s leaders brought our people and the nation to a position of bankruptcy through corrupt practices. The political leaders of this country are not much different from political leaders in even the richest country in the world.",
        "During the era of prohibition in the United States, the infamous US criminal Al Capone rose to success on the back of the Temperance Movement. On January 16, 1919 prohibition was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives.",
        "Did America go dry and sober? NO. The opposite happened. The sudden non availability of liquor helped create an organised illegal manufacturing, smuggling and distribution network of alcohol and the growth of a strong mafia with enormous resources to work with.",
        "Money flowed to the leaders of the gangs, who used these resources to defend and expand their territories through violence and bribery. Shootings were commonplace. Bought-off police and politicians kept the long arm of the law at bay. The system of justice from New York to Chicago was held captive by a mafia.",
        "In our own country as in all parts of the world corruption was and continues to be prevalent. However, big-time corrupt practices commenced with the introduction of the open economic policies introduced in 1977. Then Premier JR Jayewardene who later became president in an open invitation said “Let the robber barons come”.",
        "And come they did, from law makers to petty clerks and bureaucrats, to guardians of the law, the robber barons spread their tentacles via their filthy lucre. Stories of government ministers holding extents of land and wealth abroad were well known. It was not long before it spread to the populace at large. Soon no government service could be obtained unless ‘gifts’ changed hands. Even the judiciary was silenced with daylight attacks on the homes of judges.",
        "While ordinary citizens were prosecuted for petty crimes the big sharks were free to roam the seas so to say. A classic example was how relief funds at the time of the Tsunami disaster were transferred to a private account. Though exposed no action was taken against the fraudster-corruption ruled. Since then our country has seen many a scam perpetrated and billions of dollars illegally leave the country’s shores.",
        "The recent arrest of a woman police constable for picking pockets is a different kettle of fish altogether. It is not a corrupt practice per se. It is a petty crime.",
        "What makes a respected officer stoop to the level of a thief?",
        "‘salary.lk’ reveals an average police officer receives an income ranging between Rs. 20,666 to Rs. 59,686 per month. Most of the lower-ranked khaki-clad brethren come from deprived low-income backgrounds with large families who look to them for support.",
        "During the past two to three weeks this paper has kept highlighting, that it costs over Rs. 150,000 per month for a family of four to have just two nutritious meals per day. This sum does not take into account children’s education, medical care, clothing or other basics.",
        "The story of the WPC accused of picking pockets brings to mind the novel ‘Les Misérables’ set during the French Revolution, where an accused is sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s sick and hungry son.",
        "The event highlights the desperation and inequality faced by deprived sections of our community. Sometimes theft is born out of necessity.",
        "We do not defend the action of the WPC. But her actions point to a very serious problem facing a large section of people in our country -inadequate income to cover the cost of living.",

        "Amidst concerns by the industry stakeholders about the possible impact on digital economy, the government has already worked out fresh amendments to be incorporated into the recently introduced Online Safety Act.",
        "Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena gave his ascent to the new law passed in Parliament. The government proceeded with the enactment of the new law despite criticism from various corners including the industry stakeholders who argued that the new law borders on the infringement of freedom of expression and will have an impact on digital economy in the future.",
        "The Act provides for the establishment of a Commission which is empowered to issue directives to persons, internet service providers or internet intermediaries, who have published or communicated or whose service has been used to communicate any prohibited statement. It can notice any internet service provider or internet intermediary to disable access to an online location which contains a prohibited statement by the end users in Sri Lanka or to remove such prohibited statement from such online location.",
        "In the backdrop of mounting criticism, an official of the Public Security Ministry said new amendments had been worked to be referred to the Cabinet for approval in another two weeks’ time.",
        "The official said the government completed the consultation process with the industry stakeholders- Google, Yahoo, Meta, X, Amazon etc.",
        "“We will proceed with the incorporation of the new amendments after Cabinet approval,” he said.",
        "The government can no longer disregard the industry's viewports, it means. According to the UN, digital advances can support and accelerate the achievement of each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals – from ending extreme poverty to reducing maternal and infant mortality, promoting sustainable farming and decent work, and achieving universal literacy.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation and changed the way societies and businesses function forever. Digital platforms mainly with support from social media and tech companies, including Meta, Google, AWS, Microsoft etc helped businesses in Sri Lanka during the pandemic, enabling them to overcome lockdowns through remote work and online operations.",
        "Therefore, Sri Lankan businesses, especially SMEs benefitted from digital platforms to carry out their sales and operations during this period. Currently, the digital economy in Sri Lanka is estimated to be around US $ 3.5 billion or 4.37 per cent of GDP, with exports at around US $ 1.25 billion. The Government plans to elevate this figure to 15 per cent of GDP by 2030 and thereby increase the digital economy contribution from US $ 3.5 Billion to US $ 15 billion.",
        "However, the digital economy targets can only be achieved if there are mechanisms to make Sri Lanka an attractive destination for digital investments. Since we cannot provide tax breaks and other financial incentives, the only option is to make it attractive through policy initiatives which are compatible with global standards.",
        "Over the years, Sri Lanka has adopted digital laws and policies, which are compatible with international standards. The Electronic Transactions Act was amended in 2017 to align with the UN Electronic Communications Convention (the gold standard for digital transactions & digital commerce), making Sri Lanka the first country in South Asia to achieve this standard.",
        "In 2015 Sri Lanka was able to join the Budapest Cybercrime Convention because our Computer Crimes Act (2007) was formulated in line with International standards. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act (2005), which is the framework governing digital payments, is also based on a global standard, enabling Sri Lanka to become the second in Asia to adopt real-time online payments and settlements. All these laws were drafted adopting an open transparent process.",
        "The Computer Crimes Bill (2005) was referred to a Special Standing Committee of Parliament after the debate (without putting it into second reading), which resulted in the Bill being comprehensively reviewed with stakeholders and experts.",
        "Most recently the Personal Data Protection Act (2022), the first legislation of its kind to be adopted in South Asia, followed an open and transparent process. The Drafting process which started in January 2019 ensured that every version of the Bill was published online.",
        "However, concern is raised that the Online Safety Act is not based on a global best practice and does not follow a transparent consultation process. Therefore, the Act requires further review by experts, not only from a legal perspective but from a Technology perspective.",
        "According to the experts, the basic amendments proposed by Public Security Ministry and the Attorney General does not make it implementable and workable, because the SC determination does not address implementation aspects.",
        "Some of the offences in the Act violate Articles 17 & 19 of ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).",
        "Even if those provisions are amended, it must be noted that the evidence required to successfully prosecute those offences are not in Sri Lanka.",
        "Therefore, electronic evidence needs to be obtained from tech companies. This requires Sri Lanka to have a successful international cooperation regime with tech companies. Therefore, it has to be amended in cooperation with tech companies.",
        "Making amendments to the Act in a rush without a consultative process will not create a conducive framework, where digital platforms and other tech companies will have the confidence to invest in Sri Lanka to enable us achieve the digital economy targets.",
        "This bill also impacts the implementation aspects of the Data Protection Act No 9 of 2022 given the sweeping powers vested in the new Commission."

        "“We don’t preview our sanctions tools. But in discussions I’ve had, all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table,” Yellen added.",
        "She said that the Treasury and State Department have taken previous action to contain Iran’s “destabilizing” behavior by diminishing its ability to export oil.",
        "“Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do. I don’t want to preview our actual sanctions activities, but certainly that remains in focus as a possible area that we could address.”",
        "Treasury was working to enlist the aid of China, G7 partners and other major global suppliers to erode Iran’s ability to continue to export oil and to get the microelectronics needed for the drones it used to attack Israel and was selling to Russia, a senior Treasury official told reporters.",
        "The official said a jump in oil prices had been driven mainly by geopolitical uncertainty, not U.S. sanctions, and noted that past sanctions had not led to oil price increases.",
        "“We’re going to have conversations with all major suppliers around the world. That includes countries in the G7; that includes China. All of these countries have to play a role in constraining Iran’s ability to get access to the goods they are using to build weapons,” the official said.",
        "In prepared remarks, Yellen said Iran’s attack on Israel last weekend and its financing of militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq threatened stability in the Middle East and could cause economic spillovers.",
        "The United States is using financial sanctions to isolate Iran and disrupt its ability to fund proxy groups and support Russia’s war in Ukraine, Yellen said.",
        "Treasury has targeted more than 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Biden administration in January 2021, Yellen said.",
        "That has included targeting Iran’s drone and missile programs and its financing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iraqi militia groups, she said.",
        "“From this weekend’s attack to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Iran’s actions threaten the region’s stability and could cause economic spillovers,” Yellen said, without giving details.",
        "Iran on Saturday launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers.",
        "Israel’s military said that it shot down almost all the drones and missiles, and that the attack caused no deaths, but the situation has increased fears of open warfare between the longtime foes.",
        "In Gaza, more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched against Hamas after the group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",
        "Yellen said Washington was continuing to use economic tools to pressure Hamas, but said Treasury was emphasizing that its sanctions should not impede life-saving aid.",
        "She called for urgent action to end Palestinian suffering in the narrow enclave, noting that Gaza’s entire population of more than 2 million people was facing acute food insecurity and that most of the population had been displaced.",
        "“It is incumbent on all of us here at these meetings to do everything in our power to end this suffering,” she said.",
        "Yellen noted that Washington was also using sanctions to target extreme settler violence in the West Bank, while working to ensure a functioning banking system there and supporting IMF programs in Jordan and Egypt."

        "(Reuters) - Every major global climate record was broken last year and 2024 could be worse, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday, with its chief voicing particular concern about ocean heat and shrinking sea ice.",
        "The U.N. weather agency said in its annual State of the Global Climate report that average temperatures hit the highest level in 174 years of record-keeping by a clear margin, reaching 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",
        "Ocean temperatures also reached the warmest in 65 years of data with over 90% of the seas having experienced heatwave conditions during the year, the WMO said, harming food systems.",
        "“The WMO community is sounding the Red Alert to the world,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo, who took over the job in January.",
        "“What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern.”",
        "She later told reporters that ocean heat was particularly concerning because it was “almost irreversible”, possibly taking millennia to reverse.",
        "“The trend is really very worrying and that is because of the characteristics of water that keep heat content for longer than the atmosphere,” she said.",
        "Climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, coupled with the emergence of the natural El Nino climate pattern, pushed the world into record territory in 2023.",
        "WMO’s head of climate monitoring, Omar Baddour, told reporters there was a “high probability” that 2024 would set new heat records, saying that the year after an El Nino was typically warmer still.",
        "Tuesday’s report showed a big plunge in Antarctic sea ice, with the peak level measured at 1 million km2 below the previous record - an area roughly equivalent to the size of Egypt.",
        "That trend, combined with ocean warming which causes water to expand, has contributed to a more than doubling of the rate of sea-level rise over the past decade compared with the 1993-2002 period, it said.",
        "Ocean heat was concentrated in the North Atlantic with temperatures an average 3 degrees Celsius above average in late 2023, the report said. Warmer ocean temperatures affect delicate marine ecosystems and many fish species have fled north from this area seeking cooler temperatures.",
        "Saulo, a meteorologist from Argentina who has promised to strengthen global warning systems for climate disasters, said she hoped the report would raise awareness of the “vital need to scale up the urgency and ambition of climate action”.",
        "“That’s why we spoke about the Red Alert because we must care for the people and how they will suffer from these more frequent, more extreme events,” she told reporters. “If we do nothing, things will become worse and that will be our responsibility.”"

        "Tehran played down the incident and indicated it had no plans for retaliation - a response that appeared gauged towards averting region-wide war.",
        "“Whilst the initial spike in oil may have highlighted the initial fear of further escalation, we have seen both equities and crude reverse some of those preliminary moves,” said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.",
        "“Events of the past week appear to be more about showing their willingness to act rather than actually seeking to incite a war ...For markets this is a best case scenario”.",

But also, the private sector has an essential role to play in building social cohesion and inclusion, starting at the workplace.” She further stated ” Improving business performance is an imperative at a time of crisis, and the report presented today shows clearly the linkages between economic growth, inclusiveness and social justice and the opportunities for businesses in Sri Lanka to embrace diversity and contribute to build a more resilient and prosperous society”.",

        "(AP) — Narendra Modi was sworn in Sunday for a rare third consecutive term as India’s prime minister, relying on his coalition partners after his party failed to win a parliamentary majority in a surprise outcome.",
        "Modi and his Cabinet ministers took the oath of office, administered by President Droupadi Murmu, at India’s presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi.",
        "The 73-year-old popular but polarizing leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term.",
        "His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modi’s National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm.",
        "This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament.",
        "Final election results released Wednesday showed Modi’s BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 needed for a majority. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition secured 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of Parliament.",
        "Modi’s coalition government now largely depends on two key regional allies — the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state — to stay in power.",
        "Meanwhile, Modi’s political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the resurgent Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, doubling its strength from the last election to win 232 seats.",
        "An avowed Hindu nationalist, the prime minister is considered a champion of the country’s Hindu majority, who make up 80% of India’s 1.4 billion population. His supporters credit him with rapid economic growth and improving India’s global standing since coming to power.",
        "But critics say he’s also undermined India’s democracy and its status as a secular nation with attacks by Hindu nationalists against the country’s minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media. His political opponents have questioned his government’s economic record, pointing to high unemployment and growing inequality despite strong growth.",
        "Several South Asian leaders attended the swearing-in ceremony Sunday, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu.",
        "Tensions between India and Maldives have grown since Muizzu was elected last year. He has since taken a pro-China stance and removed Indian troops stationed on one of Maldives’ islets."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "ECONOMYNEXT – A member of the team that drafted Sri Lanka’s 19th amendment to the constitution has explained the constraint they worked with, which has led to the possibility of a 6-year Presidential term enabled by a two thirds’ majority vote.",
        "The deficiency in the constitution was highlighted in a report by EconomyNext on Tuesday.",
        "President’s Counsel Jayampathy Wickramaratne, a member of the drafting team, explained that they were instructed not to make changes that required a referendum.",
        "The team was advised that a bill to amend the constitution should be passed “only by a two-thirds majority, in keeping with the pledge of Presidential candidate Maithripala Sirisena in his election manifesto that no amendment necessitating a Referendum would be placed before Parliament.",
        "“As such, the draft did not propose reducing the maximum period from six to five years.”",
        "However he argues why the Presidential term should not go beyond five years in the the present case, on several grounds, including the circumstances of ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s election by the people, democratic principles and constitutional morality.",
        "I refer to the new item titled ‘Constitutional Error Could Give Ranil and Parliament Another Year’ written by your Political Correspondent in your esteemed journal. It is implied therein that the drafters of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution ‘neglected’ to ensure that the maximum period to which the term of the President and Parliament could be extended without recourse to a Referendum was also reduced to five years while reducing the respective terms to five years.",
        "As a member of the team that drafted the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, I wish to make a clarification for the benefit of your readers. Article 83 lists the constitutional provisions which cannot be changed without a Referendum. The news item reproduces Article 83. You might note the words ‘and this Article’ in Article 83(b). Thus, to reduce the maximum period to five years, Article 83 itself must be amended, requiring a Referendum. The drafting team was well aware of this necessity.",
        "However the government had clearly advised the drafting team that the Nineteenth Amendment Bill should be passed only by a two-thirds majority, in keeping with the pledge of Presidential candidate Maithripala Sirisena in his election manifesto that no amendment necessitating a Referendum would be placed before Parliament. As such, the draft did not propose reducing the maximum period from six to five years.",
        "I wish to take this opportunity to express my views on whether the five-year terms of the current Parliament and the current President could be extended to six years, as the maximum period mentioned in Article 83 is six years.",
        "When the People of Sri Lanka voted Gotabhaya Rajapakse as President and later elected the present Parliament, the term of the President and Parliament was five years.",
        "Voters knew that Parliament could be dissolved earlier in the circumstances laid down in the Constitution and that the President could seek a fresh mandate after four years in office.",
        "However, the upper limit of each term was clearly five years. As the People voted for a President and a Parliament for only five years, such a Parliament cannot extend the terms by even a day as that would violate the franchise already exercised by the People.",
        "Any amendment of the Constitution that impinges on the franchise must be approved by the People at a Referendum, as the franchise (Article 3, read with Article 4) is an entrenched provision listed in Article 83. Any increase in the duration of the term of the President or Parliament can apply only to a new President or a new Parliament for whom the People vote knowing what the applicable term is.",
        "On this issue, I take the further view that a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a 50-%-Plus-One majority of the People cannot make ANY amendment to the Constitution.",
        "In international law, certain basic norms (jus cogens) are accepted as peremptory norms from which no derogation is permitted. Examples include prohibitions against slavery and torture, genocide, the use of armed force and piracy on the high seas and racial non-discrimination.",
        "Similarly, are there basic norms from which a democracy such as Sri Lanka cannot derogate? Can a tyrannous majority adopt any constitution? Would the Supreme Court have the power to examine a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution or a new Constitution, certified by the Cabinet of Ministers as one that requires the People’s approval at a referendum, if certain basic democratic norms are alleged to be violated? Such questions may seem academic at first blush, but given experiences from elsewhere, should they be brushed aside?",
        "When freedom from torture is recognised as a peremptory norm that binds the international community, can the People of Sri Lanka restrict its application within the country, invoking their sovereignty? Put differently, are there no limits to the internal dimension of sovereignty?",
        "The Lawyers Collective recently raised the pertinent question of whether the amending process is also governed by the principle of ‘constitutional morality’, a concept which has recently gained wide acceptance in India.",
        "Simply put, constitutional morality demands that the spirit of the Constitution be respected and should not be undermined even at the behest of the majority. It is thus a counterpoise to popular or social morality that can sometimes be undemocratic and violative of rights.",
        "In Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, the Indian Supreme Court observed as follows: “The concept of constitutional morality is not limited to the mere observance of the core principles of constitutionalism as the magnitude and sweep of constitutional morality is not confined to the provisions and literal text which a Constitution contains, rather it embraces within itself virtues of a wide magnitude such as that of ushering a pluralistic and inclusive society, while at the same time adhering to the other principles of constitutionalism.”",
        "The Court explained that it is further the result of embodying constitutional morality that the values of constitutionalism trickle down and percolate through the apparatus of the State for the betterment of each and every individual citizen of the State.",
        "“The society as a whole or even a minuscule part of the society may aspire and prefer different things for themselves. They are perfectly competent to have such a freedom to be different, like different things, so on and so forth, provided that their different tastes and liking remain within their legal framework and neither violates any statute nor results in the abridgement of fundamental rights of any other citizen. The Preambular goals of our Constitution which contain the noble objectives of Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity can only be achieved through the commitment and loyalty of the organs of the State to the principle of constitutional morality.” (AIR 2018 SC 4321).",
        "My view is that peremptory norms that limit the internal dimension of sovereignty are found in the Preamble to our Constitution, which refers to ‘immutable republican principles of representative democracy’ that assure to ‘all peoples freedom, equality, justice, fundamental human rights and the independence of the judiciary as the intangible heritage that guarantees the dignity and well-being of succeeding generations of the People of Sri Lanka’.",
        "Increasing the terms of the current President and Parliament who were elected for five years goes against those ‘immutable republican principles of representative democracy.’"

        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s statement in parliament on increasing withholding tax on conservative investments, such as fixed deposits and savings, from 5 percent to 10 percent, positively impacted the stock market and attracted more local and foreign investors, market analysts said.",
        "This new withholdings tax increase by the government does not apply to stock market transactions. Amid those developments mixed reactions were noted in both indices yesterday. The All Share Price Index went up by 39.96 points, while S and P SL20 went down by 3.28 points. Turnover stood at Rs 5.8 billion with 12 crossings.",
        "Those crossings were reported in LVL Energy where 68.8 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 407.2 million; its shares traded at Rs 6, Sunshine Holdings 1 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 86 million, its shares traded at Rs 86, PickMe 1.19 million shares crossed for Rs 78 million; its shares traded at Rs 5.70, CIC Holdings 802,000 shares crossed for 72.2 million; its shares sold at Rs 90, HNB 200,000 shares crossed for Rs 54.8 million; its shares traded at Rs 274, Commercial Bank 300,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 40.8 million; its shares sold at Rs 136, PGP Glass 958,000 shares crossed to the tune of Rs 29.7 million; its shares traded at Rs 31, JKH 1 million shares crossed to the tune of Rs 22.50 million, its shares traded at Rs 22.50, Commercial Bank 200,000 shares crossed for Rs 21.1 million; its shares traded at Rs 105.50, Commercial Credit and Finance 425,000 shares crossed for Rs 20.80 and its shares sold at Rs 49, Vallibel One 400,000 shares crossed for Rs 20.8 million; its shares traded at Rs 52 and Maravila Resorts 3.2 million shares crossed for Rs 20.4 million; its shares fetched Rs 6.40.",
        "In the retail market, companies that mainly contributed to the turnover were; JKH Rs 381 million (16.9 million shares traded), LMF Rs 369 million (89 million shares traded), Kotagala Plantations Rs 218 million (23.3 million shares traded), Lanka IOC Rs 174 million (1.3 million shares traded), LV Energy Rs 107.5 million (26 million shares traded) and Dipped Products Rs 161 million (3.1million shares traded). During the day 365 million share volumes changed hands in 36000 transactions.",
        "It is said that the services sector is leading the market, especially LVL Energy and Pickme. Moreover, the manufacturing sector is also active in the market, especially JKH.",
        "Yesterday the rupee depreciated steeply to Rs 292.70/293.00 to the US dollar in the spot market, from Rs 291.25/50 to the US dollar the previous day, while bond yields were up, dealers said.",
        "Analysts had warned that if excess liquidity was allowed to build up, including from acquisition of dollars, the currency will weaken when they are used for imports as domestic prices are pushed up from higher demand.",
        "If domestic demand and credit is pushed up from liquidity from Central Bank dollar rupee swaps the same consequence will follow as there was no commitment to defend the currency against excess liquidity under a so-called flexible exchange rate.",
        "Flexible exchange rates, coupled with money printed to reach high cost of living targets, have triggered social unrest and also sovereign default in reserve collecting Central Banks.",
        "A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted at 9.75/80 percent. A bond maturing on 15.02.2028 was quoted at 10.10/15 percent. A bond maturing on 01.05.2028 was quoted stable at 10.20/25 percent. A bond maturing on 15.09.2029 was quoted stable at 10.65/70 percent.",

      "original_title": "Biden welcomes King of Jordan as framework for hostage deal is decided in Israel-Hamas conflict",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "President Joe Biden is hosting Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over a possible Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah.",
        "It is the first meeting between the allies since three American troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.",
        "The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are working to broker another pause in Israel’s war against Hamas in order to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over the administration’s continued support for Israel in the face of growing casualties in Gaza.",
        "It appeared a deal for another pause in the fighting was getting close. A senior U.S. administration official said Sunday that after weeks of shuttle diplomacy and phone conversations, a framework was essentially in place for a deal that could see the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for a halt to fighting.",
        "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, acknowledged that gaps remained but declined to specify what they are.",
        "The official said Israeli military pressure on Hamas in Khan Younis over the last several weeks has helped bring the militant group closer to accepting an agreement. The potential for an agreement took up the majority of Biden’s call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "The official said the two leaders also had a significant back and forth about the potential expansion of Israeli military operations into Rafah and that Biden reiterated U.S. opposition to the idea under the “current conditions” while more than 1.3 million people are sheltering there.",
        "It was the most forceful language yet from the president on the possible operation. Biden, who last week called Israel’s military response in Gaza “over the top,” also sought “urgent and specific” steps to strengthen humanitarian aid. Israel’s Channel 13 television said the conversation lasted 45 minutes.",
        "The official said the Israelis “made clear they would not contemplate an operation” in Rafah without safeguarding the civilian population. The official said the U.S. is not sure there is a feasible or implementable plan to relocate civilians out of Rafah to allow military operations to take place.",
        "Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israel’s actions and have eschewed public support for long-term planning over what happens next, arguing that the fighting must end before such discussions can begin. They have been demanding a cease-fire since mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket.",
        "Biden had planned to visit Jordan during his trip to Israel in October shortly after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, but the trip was scrapped. On his way home from Israel, Biden announced he’d helped broker the first deal to pause fighting temporarily and to open the crossing in Rafah to humanitarian aid.",
        "In the months since, members of his administration have made repeated trips to the region to engage with leaders there."

Fernando was instructed to pay Rs. 50 million, and Mendis Rs. 10 million. These funds were designated to compensate the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks."

      "original_body_lines": [
        "A post-dated cheque represents a future promise to pay, not a completed transaction",
        "A post-dated cheque is a regular cheque with a future date written on it. This means the cheque writer instructs the bank not to pay the cheque until that future date arrives.",
        "Purpose: People use them to ensure the recipient waits to deposit the cheque. There are a couple of reasons for this:",
        "The writer doesn’t have enough funds currently but expects to by the future date.",
        "The cheque is for a prepayment, like paying for a service before it’s completed.",
        "Validity: The rules around post-dated cheques can vary depending on the country. In some places, like the US and UK, banks can process them even before the written date. In other places, like India and Australia, the bank has to wait until the date on the cheque.",
        "Legality: Post-dated cheques are generally legal and considered negotiable instruments.",
        "It’s important to be aware of the rules in your area to avoid any confusion or problems when using post-dated cheques.",
        "Post-dated cheques are fairly common in Sri Lanka, though their use is being discouraged. Here’s a breakdown of how they’re used and the current sentiment:",
        "Deferred payment: Similar to other countries, post-dated cheques are used to secure a future payment, especially when the payer doesn’t have sufficient funds currently but expects to by the written date.",
        "Prepayment: They act as a guarantee for services or goods to be delivered later.",
        "Bounced cheques: A major concern is that cheques often “bounce” due to insufficient funds, leading to strained relationships with banks and recipients.",
        "Shift towards electronic payments: The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is encouraging a shift towards more reliable and efficient electronic payment methods.",
        "Overall, while post-dated cheques are still used in Sri Lanka, there’s a push for adopting alternative payment methods due to the risk of bounced cheques.",
        "While it’s true that post-dated cheques can be used in some situations, it’s not generally recommended for businesses to rely on them to solve cash flow requirements. Because:",
        "Unreliable source of funds: Post-dated cheques aren’t guaranteed. There’s a risk the cheque will bounce due to insufficient funds on the due date, creating a cash flow problem instead of solving one.",
        "Delayed access to funds: Even if the cheque is honoured, you won’t have immediate access to the money. You’ll need to wait for the cheque to clear, which can take several days. This can disrupt your cash flow if you need the funds quickly.",
        "Risk of fraudulent cheques: Lost or stolen post-dated cheques can be altered and cashed fraudulently, leading to financial loss.",
        "Inefficient and outdated: Modern electronic payment methods are faster, more secure, and offer better record-keeping.",
        "Negotiate payment terms: Try negotiating extended payment terms with suppliers to give yourself more time to collect payments from customers.",
        "Offer discounts for early payment: Incentivise customers to pay sooner by offering discounts for early payments. This can help improve your cash flow.",
        "Explore financing options: Consider short-term loans or lines of credit to bridge cash flow gaps. However, use these options cautiously to avoid accumulating debt.",
        "Improve accounts receivable management: Implement a system for tracking outstanding invoices and following up with late payers promptly. This can help you collect payments faster.",
        "Embrace electronic payments: Shift towards electronic payment methods like EFTs, online payment gateways, or mobile wallets. These offer faster settlements and improved cash flow visibility",
        "By focusing on these alternative strategies, businesses can achieve better control over their cash flow and avoid the risks associated with post-dated cheques.",
        "Can post-dated cheques be used to get finance facilities from various financial institutions by way of factoring and other similar manner?",
        "No, generally post-dated cheques cannot be used to secure financing from financial institutions through methods like factoring. Because:",
        "Uncertainty of funds: Financial institutions rely on guaranteed access to funds. Post-dated cheques are uncertain because:",
        "The cheque issuer might not have sufficient funds on the due date.",
        "Delayed collection: Even if valid, there’s a delay in collecting the funds. The financial institution would have to wait for the cheque to clear, impacting their own cash flow.",
        "Limited value: Factoring companies typically deal with invoices representing completed sales. A post-dated cheque represents a future promise to pay, not a completed transaction.",
        "Factoring: Businesses can use factoring to sell their accounts receivable (invoices) to a factoring company at a discount. The factor collects the payments from customers, providing immediate cash flow. However, the business receives less than the invoice value.",
        "Invoice discounting: Similar to factoring, but the business collects payments from customers and remits a portion to the financial institution. This offers more control but requires managing collections.",
        "Security deposit: In rare cases, a financial institution might accept a post-dated cheque as part of a larger loan application, but only as additional security alongside a primary source of collateral.",
        "In conclusion, while post-dated cheques might seem like a way to secure financing, they are not a reliable option.",
        "In Sri Lanka generally how does the time vary when dating the cheques as post-dated cheques? Is there any law restriction to guide on this dating? How is it in other parts of the world?",
        "In Sri Lanka, there are no specific legal restrictions on the dating period for post-dated cheques. However, there are some general practices and considerations to keep in mind:",
        "Banking practices: Most Sri Lankan banks won’t cash a post-dated cheque before the written date. This is a bank policy, not necessarily a legal requirement.",
        "Validity period: Even for post-dated cheques, there’s a general validity period maximum of six months from the date of issue. After that period, the cheque may not be honoured by the bank.",
        "Risks of early cashing: In some cases, depending on the bank’s policy, a post-dated cheque might be cashed before the written date. This can cause problems if you weren’t expecting the funds to be withdrawn early.",
        "Variations exist: Regulations around post-dated cheques vary from country to country.",
        "US and UK: Banks aren’t obligated to wait for the written date and can process the cheque earlier.",
        "India and Australia: Banks typically wait for the date on the cheque before encashing it.",
        "Shifting landscape: Globally, there’s a move away from post-dated cheques due to the risks involved. Electronic payment methods are becoming increasingly popular due to their speed, security, and convenience.",
        "It’s crucial to communicate clearly with the recipient of the post-dated cheque about the expected deposit date to avoid any confusion.",
        "For better security and reliability, explore electronic payment methods like EFTs or online payment gateways whenever possible.",
        "While post-dated cheques are still used in Sri Lanka, it’s important to be aware of the associated risks and consider alternative payment methods for a smoother and more secure financial transaction.",
        "Why post-dated cheques with dates exceeding 6 months might still be used in Sri Lanka",
        "There are several reasons why post-dated cheques with dates exceeding six months might still be used in Sri Lanka, despite the various drawbacks:",
        "Habit and tradition: For many businesses and individuals, post-dated cheques have been the norm for a long time. Shifting to new practices can take time, especially for those comfortable with the familiar system.",
        "Large transactions: For very large transactions, especially those involving instalments or future payments, post-dated cheques spread out over a long period (more than 6 months) might be used as a way to secure a future commitment.",
        "Limited access to electronic methods: While Sri Lanka is making strides towards digital payments, there might still be pockets with limited access to reliable internet or user-friendly electronic payment platforms. This could make traditional cheques more accessible in those areas.",
        "Lack of awareness: Some businesses and individuals might not be fully aware of the risks associated with long-dated post-dated cheques, or the benefits and security offered by electronic payment alternatives.",
        "Perceived control: For some, using post-dated cheques might provide a perceived sense of control over the flow of funds, especially if they are unsure about their future financial situation.",
        "However, it’s important to remember that even though these reasons exist, there’s a growing push to move away from post-dated cheques:",
        "Government initiatives: As discussed earlier, the Sri Lankan Government is promoting financial literacy and the adoption of electronic payments. This is further exemplified by Gazette Notification Number: 2378/33, dated 4 April 2024, under the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017. In accordance with the authority granted, tax payments can now be made to the Commissioner General through cash deposits, pay order or bank draft deposits, and through the Online Tax Payments Platform (OTPP).",
        "Banking system: Banks might discourage long-dated cheques due to the risk of bounced payments and the strain it puts on their own cash flow management.",
        "Business risks: Businesses themself are increasingly aware of the risks associated with bounced cheques, including damaged customer relationships and potential legal issues.",
        "Overall, while long-dated post-dated cheques are still used in Sri Lanka, it’s a trend that’s likely to decline as electronic payment methods become more widespread, secure, and accessible.",
        "There are a few risks to consider when using post-dated cheques:",
        "Early cashing: Even though the cheque has a future date, the bank might still cash it. In some countries, like the US and UK, banks aren’t obligated to wait for the written date. This can cause problems if you were relying on the funds being available until the later date.",
        "Insufficient funds: This is a major risk. If you don’t have enough money in your account by the date written on the cheque, it will bounce and lead to fees from your bank. In some cases, it could also result in legal trouble depending on the laws in the particular country.",
        "Fraud: A lost or stolen post-dated cheque can be altered and cashed fraudulently, causing financial loss. There’s also a risk of identity theft if the cheque contains your personal details.",
        "Miscommunication: There can be confusion between the payer and recipient about when the cheque can be deposited. This can lead to tension and unexpected fees.",
        "Outdated method: Electronic payment methods are generally faster, more secure, and offer better tracking. In some places, like Sri Lanka, there’s a push to move away from post-dated cheques altogether.",
        "Here’s how a business entity can reduce the risks associated with using post-dated cheques:",
        "Know your bank’s policy: Familiarise yourself with your bank’s policy on post-dated cheques. In some regions, banks aren’t obligated to wait for the written date.",
        "Consider alternatives: If early cashing is a major concern, explore safer options like electronic funds transfers (EFTs) or secure online payment methods.",
        "Strong cash flow management: Implement robust financial planning to ensure sufficient funds are available when the cheque is due.",
        "Pre-authorisation: In some cases, banks might offer pre-authorisation for post-dated cheques. This verifies you’ll have the funds by the due date but doesn’t guarantee the cheque won’t be cashed early (depending on bank policy).",
        "Secure storage: Store post-dated cheques securely to prevent loss or theft. Consider using a locked safe or a secure filing cabinet.",
        "Limited information: Minimise the personal information written on the cheque. Only include essential details like the payee name, date, and amount.",
        "Written agreements: Establish clear written agreements with anyone receiving post-dated cheques. Specify the due date for depositing the cheque and any relevant details about the payment.",
        "Electronic records: Maintain electronic records of issued post-dated cheques, including the payee, date, amount, and any agreements.",
        "Shift to electronic payments: Whenever possible, transition towards electronic payment methods like EFTs or online payment gateways. These offer faster processing, better security, and clear audit trails.",
        "Phased approach: If a complete shift is difficult, consider a phased approach. Start by using electronic payments for low-risk transactions and gradually phase out post-dated cheques.",
        "By following these strategies, businesses can significantly reduce the risks associated with using post-dated cheques. In the long run, adopting secure and reliable electronic payment methods is often the best course of action.",
        "What are the remedies available for business entities to overcome these risk factors and non-honouring of these post-dated cheques on the future said dates and what are the legal remedies available for affected persons?",
        "Shift to electronic payments: This is the most effective way to avoid bounced cheques altogether. It’s faster, more secure, and leaves a clear audit trail.",
        "Creditworthiness checks: Before accepting post-dated cheques, consider running credit checks on customers, especially for larger transactions.",
        "Security deposits: In some cases, a security deposit can be an alternative to a post-dated cheque, mitigating the risk of non-payment.",
        "Clear agreements: Establish written agreements outlining the terms of the payment, including the due date for depositing the cheque and late payment penalties.",
        "Stop payment order: Immediately contact your bank and request a stop payment order on the dishonoured cheque. This prevents further attempts to cash it. (Fees may apply)",
        "Demand letter: Send a formal demand letter to the customer outlining the non-payment and requesting immediate settlement.",
        "Collection agencies: For persistent defaulters, consider involving a collection agency to recover the debt.",
        "Negotiable Instruments Act: Sri Lanka’s Negotiable Instruments Act (NIA) outlines legal recourse for dishonoured cheques.",
        "Lawsuit for recovery: Businesses can file a lawsuit against the customer to recover the outstanding amount. This can be a lengthy and expensive process.",
        "Criminal charges: In some cases, depending on the severity and intent, businesses may be able to press criminal charges for issuing a dud cheque. However, this requires a strong case and cooperation from law enforcement.",
        "Legal fees: Lawsuits and criminal charges can be costly. Weigh the potential recovery against the legal expenses.",
        "Customer relationships: Legal action can damage customer relationships. Consider the long-term consequences before pursuing this route.",
        "Mediation: Mediation can be a quicker and less expensive way to resolve the issue with the customer. A neutral third party can facilitate a discussion to reach an agreement.",
        "Consult with an expert professional with Sri Lankan commercial law for specific legal advice based on your situation. They can guide you on the most appropriate course of action for recovering your funds.",
        "The overall solution to the problems and issues surrounding post-dated cheques is a gradual shift towards secure and reliable electronic payment methods. Because:",
        "Reduced risks: Electronic payments eliminate the risks of early cashing, insufficient funds, fraud, and miscommunication associated with cheques.",
        "Increased efficiency: They offer faster processing times, improved record-keeping, and easier reconciliation.",
        "Enhanced security: Many electronic payment methods come with robust security features to protect your finances.",
        "Promote electronic payments: Actively encourage customers to adopt electronic payment options. Offer incentives or discounts to make the switch more appealing.",
        "Phase out cheques: Develop a plan to gradually phase out post-dated cheques in favour of electronic methods. Start with low-risk transactions and work your way up.",
        "Embrace digital payments: Whenever possible, opt for electronic payment methods when dealing with businesses. They’re generally faster, safer, and more convenient.",
        "Understand cheque risks: If you must accept a post-dated cheque, be aware of the associated risks and ensure clear communication about the due date for depositing it.",
        "Promote financial literacy: Educational campaigns can raise awareness about the benefits and security of electronic payments compared to traditional cheques.",
        "Invest in infrastructure: Ensure Sri Lanka has a robust digital payment infrastructure that is accessible and user-friendly for businesses and individuals alike.",
        "By working together, businesses, individuals, and financial institutions can create a more efficient and secure financial ecosystem that minimises the problems associated with post-dated cheques.",
        "The Sri Lankan Government can play a key role in tackling the issues surrounding post-dated cheques by promoting a shift towards electronic payments and potentially implementing some legal changes. Here’s a breakdown of possible approaches:",
        "Financial literacy campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns educating citizens about the benefits and security of electronic payment methods. Highlight the risks associated with post-dated cheques.",
        "Incentivise businesses and consumers: Offer tax breaks or other incentives to businesses that encourage electronic payments. Consider cashback rewards or discounts for consumers who use electronic options.",
        "Invest in infrastructure: Ensure Sri Lanka has a robust digital payment infrastructure. This includes promoting affordable internet access, user-friendly mobile banking apps, and widespread acceptance of electronic payment methods by merchants.",
        "Limited use of post-dated cheques: The Government could consider gradually phasing out the use of post-dated cheques for specific transactions. This could be a phased approach, starting with high-value transactions first.",
        "Regulation of early cashing: Laws could be implemented to mandate that banks wait for the written date on a post-dated cheque before cashing it.",
        "Strengthening penalties for dishonoured cheques: While Sri Lanka has the Negotiable Instruments Act, consider reviewing and potentially strengthening the penalties for issuing dud cheques. This could deter misuse.",
        "Balance with traditional practices: Some Sri Lankans might prefer cheques due to lack of internet access or unfamiliarity with electronic methods. The Government should ensure a smooth transition that caters to all demographics.",
        "Consultation with stakeholders: Collaborate with banks, businesses, and consumer protection agencies when considering legal changes. This ensures a well-rounded approach.",
        "Promoting secured cheque systems: As a temporary measure, the government could explore promoting the use of secured cheque systems with enhanced security features to reduce fraud risks. However, this wouldn’t address all issues associated with cheques.",
        "By focusing on promoting electronic payments, potentially implementing targeted legal changes, and considering the needs of all citizens, the Sri Lankan Government can create a more secure and efficient financial system for everyone.",
        "In conclusion, while post-dated cheques have been a longstanding practice in Sri Lanka, their limitations and risks are becoming increasingly apparent. The future of Sri Lanka’s financial landscape lies in secure and efficient electronic payments. Businesses can lead the way by adopting these methods and phasing out cheques. The Government can play a crucial role by promoting financial literacy, incentivising electronic transactions, and potentially implementing legal changes to discourage reliance on cheques. By embracing a digital future, Sri Lanka can create a more streamlined and secure financial system that benefits businesses, individuals, and the entire economy.",

        "Officials from 46 member nations of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization will participate in roundtable discussions that focus on lessons learned from the pandemic and its impact on food security and nutrition, modernization and digitization for smallholders in aquaculture and livestock, building resilience through agrifood systems transformation, the need for investment and financing for poverty reduction and modernization, and saving food and water and reducing food loss and waste, at the 37th Ministerial Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC37).",
        "“Many challenges remain to fight hunger, poverty and inequalities,” the FAO said in a statement, adding “The global pandemic and years of environmental crises have hit this region disproportionately hard, with economic progress and individual livelihoods regressed, and floods, droughts and tropical storms badly affecting agricultural production in some parts of the region that are least resilient.",
        "“Hunger and other forms of malnutrition persist, with nearly 371 million people in Asia-Pacific who are undernourished. At the same time, the increasing cost of a healthy diet is leaving many families unable to afford one.",
        "“Given the setbacks over the last two years, and the decline in progress in the fight against hunger that preceded the pandemic, it is essential to transform the region’s food systems so that they become more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable,” the Conference delegates heard during today’s (19) opening session.",
        "Three pathways were proposed in order for FAO member nations to accelerate this Agrifood Systems Transformation.",
        "“First, by identifying and implementing food systems transformation pathways through the process fostered by the UN Food Systems Summit 2021, and the follow-up to that Summit, the ‘Stock Taking Moment’ convened last year.",
        "“Second, to end hunger there must be much more investment and financing for such a transformation – both from governments and from the private sector and other international financial institutions.",
        "“And finally, the region needed to build resilience in its plant, livestock, fisheries, and forestry sectors, while promoting nature-based solutions and emphasizing science, innovation and digitalization in communities large and small while disseminating climate and energy-smart agricultural practices.”",
        "Civil society organizations and the private sector have been invited to speak at the conference. FAO Director-General, Dr QU Dongyu, is leading a delegation from FAO headquarters in Rome to participate in the four-day forum, which is hosted by the Sri Lankan Government. (Colombo/Feb19/2024)"

      "original_body_lines": [
        "There is a sustainable solution in setting up a licenced specialised national bank which I call a ‘Bad Bank’ by the Government as a public-private partnership or PPP. Its task should be to buy and restructure bad debts from the lending banks and support the MSME sector with advisory services and continuous business supervision for recovery and development. The private sector shareholders will be the licenced commercial and specialised banks. It can get funding as well as technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank’s private sector lending arm called the International Finance Corporation. Even the US Government’s international development agency known as the USAID can be invited to help.  It should be aptly named to signify its mission as a ‘National Recovery and Renewal Bank’ or NRRB",
        "The Parate Execution power, exercised by lending banks to recover non-repaid debt by borrowers by selling assets without going through the judicial processes in a recession hit economy, has become a hot topic today. While the Central Bank maintains that that power should not be removed, the legislators who represent the people think otherwise. They have jumped on the campaign wagon of the micro, small, medium, and small entrepreneurs, popularly known as MSMEs, and pressured the Government that these entrepreneurs should be given relief through an administrative direction to lending banks not to exercise this power at least till the end of the year. Since this is an election year, the Government too cannot ignore this call. Hence, it was announced that the Cabinet has decided to suspend, against the announced stand by the Central Bank on the issue, the exercise of the Parate execution power by banks in the case of the MSMEs till the end of the year. But it has led to a legal hurdle since the provisions of a law enacted by Parliament cannot be suspended by a directive from the Central Bank or a decision of the Cabinet. At most, it should be done by persuading banks not to exercise this power through moral suasion. That is a technique used by central banks throughout the world to get banks to do things which are not permitted by law by waving a stick in a threatening manner.",
        "In this background, I had a discussion with an ex-banker, Dr Anil Priyanka Baddevithana, who has experience in addressing the issue of non-performing small loans, while maintaining the safety of the funds provided by depositors. Baddevithana had been a leading figure in the formation of the HDFC Bank in Sri Lanka in early 2000s and the establishment of the HDFC Bank in the Maldives later. He was the Senior Deputy General Manager of the former and the Managing Director of the latter. Both were housing banks and therefore very much prone to the vicissitudes of the fluctuation of the economic performance of the countries concerned. When the going is good, loans, including housing loans too, do well. But when it is bad, the first casualty is the loan repayment records maintained by borrowers. In that context, the very first casualty is the MSME loans since these borrowers are the very first victims of a negative or a slow economic growth. Sri Lanka which had a negative economic growth for six consecutive quarters beginning from Q1 of 2022 and a marginal improvement in growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2023, offers the best example of delivering the death knell to the MSME sector. Since the growth expected in the next three years is also very low, compared with the country’s historical growth average of about 4% in the post-independence period, the light is very gloomy at the end of the tunnel for this sector. Hence, the sector which contributes more than a half to the national output and provides livelihood to about 65% of the work force, including self-employment opportunities, merits special treatment by the authorities.",
        "I asked Baddevithana about his views on the Cabinet decision to suspend the execution of the Parate rights by banks to provide relief to the MSME sector. “It won’t help the sector to come out of the present economic crisis” he said. “Rather it will set a bad precedent too. In future, whenever such a crisis occurs, the Governments in power will seek to resolve it, getting the banks to bear the full brunt and eye washing the borrowers. Rather, the permanent solution comes from a joint effort by banks, the Government, and the Central Bank by taking over these bad assets and rehabilitating them. This is the case for a ‘bad bank’ which I will explain fully later.”",
        "“Parate execution has a history,” he told me. “For millennia, the disputes between the borrowers and lenders were settled by resorting to judicial processes. A good example is William Shakespeare’s drama on the Merchant of Venice. It was the judges who were expected to go into the details and provide relief to either the borrower or the lender or to both. As a result, the acquisition of assets pledged by a borrower to a lender could not be done ex parte. Once the judgment was delivered, it was the duty of the fiscal officers and auctioneers to sell the asset and pay the lender. This was the principle enunciated in the Roman-Dutch Law which Sri Lanka also follows. But it took a long time, sometimes five to six years for a court to deliver a judgment on a case. In that case, the lender became a victim and therefore, he did not have incentives to lend money to borrowers at all.”",
        "I reminded him that even the banking commission appointed by the colonial Government in 1934, popularly known as the Pochkhanawala Commission headed by its chairman, had observed that Roman-Dutch Law was an obsolete legal instrument to tackle disputes between borrowers and lenders. “Yes,” said Baddevithana. “Even at that time, lending institutions in the UK had been permitted to recover debt without going through courts. Since by this time the incidence of purposeful loan defaulting too has been on the increase, Ceylonese authorities also had felt the necessity for allowing banks to recover loans by following a simple procedure. Accordingly, the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation set up in 1943 was permitted to recover debt by resorting to Parate execution. This corporation and the State Mortgage Bank were amalgamated to form the State Mortgage and Investment Bank in 1971 and the new bank was also granted the Parate execution power by the Parliament. Before this, in 1961, the People’s Bank and the Bank of Ceylon had been given the Parate execution power by the relevant statutes, again approved by Parliament. In 1985, this power was extended to the newly formed Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) through a statute approved by Parliament. Hence, Parate execution power had been used selectively by several lending institutions in Sri Lanka as approved by legislators from time to time. Ironically, it is these legislators who now ask for its temporary suspension.”",
        "I asked him how it became a general law in Sri Lanka. Explained Baddevithana: “By late 1980s, it was felt that there was no level playing field for lending institutions in Sri Lanka. The banks owned by the Government had the Parate execution power to recover loans easily, but the private banks still had to go through the cumbersome courts procedure to recover loans. To remove the inequity, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, on the advice of the then Central Bank Governor, Dr Neville Karunatilake, enacted the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act in 1990 permitting all licensed commercial banks and specialized banks to use the Parate execution power to recover debt. As a result, they all could sell an asset pledged by a borrower for a loan just by passing a resolution to that effect by its Board of Directors if the loan has become a non-performing one. They didn’t have to seek court’s approval for that. This was how it became a universal principle in Sri Lanka.”",
        "But that seems to be a draconian power being enjoyed by a section of the population, namely lending banks, to seize assets without following the judicial process, a right which people enjoy under the Roman Dutch Law. I asked him about it. Says Baddevithana: “That isn’t the case as argued by many. Parate execution isn’t the first resort to loan recovery by a lending bank. According to the best banking practices followed and instructions issued by the regulators, that is the last resort which they can turn to if all other ways of loan recovery have failed. According to these practices, banks should follow a certain set-procedure when a loan has turned sour. They should first contact the borrower who is not repaying the loan regularly and come to a settlement for it. If it does not work, then, the bank should seek to rehabilitate the borrower by helping him to come out of his problems. If this also does not work and the borrower is absconding, then, there isn’t a way for the bank to protect its depositors. It is at that stage that they should resort to Parate execution rights. Normally, it takes a one-to-two-year time-period for banks to reach that stage. Hence, it should be applied only for chronically defaulting borrowers who cannot be contacted or rehabilitated at all. Hence, it isn’t the first resort but the last resort. If banks use it as the first resort without following the due process, then, it is bad.”",
        "Then, why is there such an objection to its use today? I asked Baddevithana. “It’s a special situation,” he replied. “The economic hardship that prevailed over the last three years has affected all the businesses – large, medium, and small-scale businesses – in the country, and severe cash flow pressures have made it difficult to service debts that were taken during better times. The forecasts of growth at the time of due diligence to underwrite credit simply disappeared as the national economy collapsed under a mountain of Government debt that needed to be surmounted before any optimism or sustainability could return to the markets. Therefore, for successful utilisation of the limited breathing space given to the MSMEs with a suspension of Parate execution, there has to be planned action to protect the enterprises as well as the banks because the last moratorium given on loan recovery during the pandemic led to a compounding of the problem. Different financial institutions have used different formulas to recover the accumulated debt, making it unrealistic for businesses to grow sufficient revenue inflows in a climate of economic uncertainty, public maladministration, corruption and the brain drain. Protests, demonstrations and disruptions continue to be the way of life, making business recovery and sustainability a distant dream for many enterprises.”",
        "Baddevithana further elaborated on his point: “In terms of severely stressed sectors like tourism, NPLs are 33%, with transport and logistics at 30%. The restructuring of debt without resorting to Parate execution is a prudent practice to resolve non-performing loans in sectors like tourism where the recovery from the Easter bombing and the pandemic debacle will have to be over a very long term and unless a more proactive solution for recovery than a moratorium on the acquisition of properties of loan defaulters by banks is formulated, the industry is only delaying the inevitable, and could also take down the banks with them.”",
        "Then, what is the way out? I asked him. He said: “There is a sustainable solution in setting up a licenced specialised national bank which I call a ‘Bad Bank’ by the Government as a public-private partnership or PPP. Its task should be to buy and restructure bad debts from the lending banks and support the MSME sector with advisory services and continuous business supervision for recovery and development. The private sector shareholders will be the licenced commercial and specialised banks. It can get funding as well as technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank’s private sector lending arm called the International Finance Corporation. Even the US Government’s international development agency known as the USAID can be invited to help.  It should be aptly named to signify its mission as a ‹National Recovery and Renewal Bank’ or NRRB. The capital structure and the management can be designed to be private-led, giving all participating banks, private institutions and the Government a shared responsibility for decision-making. It should be staffed with specialised market professionals and turnaround experts possessing capabilities for recovery and development funding.”",
        "Baddevithana further elaborated on this proposed NRRB: “As for the funding structure, the participating banks would become shareholders, contributing to the capital of the bad bank, and their shareholding could be prorated according to the value of the NPLs to be sold under the supervision and approval of the Central Bank. The multilateral agencies such as the ADB or IFC may become shareholders and appoint Board Directors with an undertaking for debt funding on a business model that meets with their approval. The Central Bank’s sanctioning process for financial institutions to sell NPLs will be based on the determination of a threshold for them to manage, say, about 2.5%, which the industry achieved in 2017 while selling the rest to the NRRB on a discounted present value on a book transfer for the purchase of voting and non-voting shares according to the terms of a shareholders’ agreement. This would clean up the balance sheet of the banks where the debt provisioning will decline in proportion to the investment in the capital of NRRB.”",
        "“There is another way to boost the funding of the proposed NRRB,” says Baddevithana. “That is the use of the money recovered from stolen assets by those so-called economic assassins or miscreants about whom there is growing concern by the public today. In this way, its mission could be widened to engineer economic revival based on investment and lending to startups in special segments like artificial intelligence, food sciences, agriculture, and innovative technologies and so on. It can not only provide direct funding to them, but also guarantee for them to raise funds elsewhere.”",
        "Why do you call it a ‘Bad Bank’ if it’s so vital to the economy of Sri Lanka? I asked Baddevithana. He laughed: “That’s because it has only bad loans in its portfolio. But like the garbage which can be converted to gold through its further use in a circular economy, this bank can turn the bad loans into golden loans through its close supervision and technical support. Hence, it’s a matter of time that the so called ‘Bad Bank’ will be known as the ‘Golden Bank’. Let’s hope for this.”",

        "Hope is said to spring eternal. Hence desperate attempts to delay the next presidential election, which the government politicians are scared of. Two fundamental rights petitions seeking a Supreme Court (SC) intervention to prevent the Election Commission (EC) from declaring the presidential poll have failed. The SC has censured the petitioners for wasting judicial time and imposed costs.",
        "One of the petitioners is a lawyer by profession. What possessed him to claim that the 19th Amendment was not valid, and a referendum had to be held? He created some confusion in the public mind. Is it that he cannot read and understand the Constitution or has not studied the judicial decisions pertaining to the 19th Amendment? Or, was he acting as a proxy for a politician with a hidden agenda? It is hoped that the judicial gavel blow that has sent him reeling will have a deterrent effect on others of his ilk, and, more importantly, the burden of the judiciary, which is already overstretched with mounting cases and limited resources, will not be aggravated.",
        "Those who fear elections are likely to explore other avenues to postpone the presidential poll. No wonder a constitutional amendment the government is planning to present to Parliament purportedly to resolve some ambiguity anent the presidential and parliamentary terms has come to be viewed with suspicion; the Opposition and independent legal experts have warned that the government is trying to set in motion a process that will cause the presidential election to be postponed. It is also possible that by proposing the 22nd Amendment, the government has sought to convince the public that it is not opposed to the five-year presidential term and had nothing to do with the abortive FR petitions at issue.",
        "Unfortunately, some non-issues have come to eclipse real problems troubling the country. Obviously, the framers of the 19th Amendment left some sections of the Constitution untouched because they apply only to the extension of the duration of the term of the President or Parliament and not a reduction thereof; they did not want a referendum held ahead of a general election for obvious reasons. The SC has dispelled doubts about the constitutional provisions at issue, and the last presidential election was held on the basis that the presidential term is five years; the matter should therefore have been considered closed.",
        "Some laws are made in such a way, in this country, that public trust in the legislative process is very low. The passage of the controversial Online Safety Bill in January is an example of how not to make laws; it was deemed passed without a vote amidst a deafening din in the well of the House, which the Opposition members invaded, claiming that the government had overlooked some SC recommendations. Most of the constitutional amendments were also steamrollered through Parliament to meet politically-determined deadlines, and some of them contain ambiguities, which have warranted numerous SC interventions. Such tinkering can weaken the integrity of the supreme law of the land. The 18th and 20th Amendments, which were introduced to help consolidate the Rajapaksa family rule serve as examples.",
        "It is high time the focus of the country was shifted from inconsequential issues and political inanities to the dire state of the economy, which has apparently been relegated to the back burner owing to election fever, which is running high. One can only hope that the political parties in the presidential fray and the public will not lose sight of the economic imperatives and the need to prioritise the successful conclusion of the ongoing economic recovery efforts over petty political issues ahead of the upcoming presidential contest. Constitutional amendments can wait.",

        "Countries at the COP29 summit in Baku adopted a $300 billion a year global finance target on Sunday to help poorer nations cope with impacts of climate change, a deal its intended recipients criticised as woefully insufficient.",
        "The agreement, clinched in overtime at the two-week conference in Azerbaijan’s capital, was meant to provide momentum for international efforts to curb global warming in a year destined to be the hottest on record.",
        "Some delegates gave the deal a standing ovation in the COP29 plenary hall. Others lambasted wealthy nations for not doing more and criticised the Azerbaijan host for hurriedly gavelling through the contentious plan.",
        "“I regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion,” Indian delegation representative Chandni Raina told the closing session of the summit, minutes after the deal was gavelled in. “This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.”",
        "United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the difficult negotiations that led to the agreement but hailed the outcome as an insurance policy for humanity against global warming.",
        "“It has been a difficult journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” Stiell said. “This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives.",
        "“But like any insurance policy, it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.”",
        "The agreement would provide $300 billion annually by 2035, boosting rich countries’ previous commitment to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020. That earlier goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025.",
        "The deal also lays the groundwork for next year’s climate summit, to be held in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where countries are meant to map out the next decade of climate action.",
        "The summit cut to the heart of the debate over financial responsibility of industrialised countries - whose historic use of fossil fuels has caused the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions - to compensate others for worsening damage from climate change.",
        "It also laid bare divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from costs of storms, floods and droughts.",
        "Negotiations had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as representatives from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus. Talks were interrupted on Saturday as some developing countries and island nations walked away in frustration.",
        "“We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need. It isn’t nearly enough, but it’s a start,” said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy.",
        "Nations have been seeking financing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur.",
        "The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1 C (5.6 F) of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 U.N. Emissions Gap report, with global greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels use continuing to rise.",
        "Sunday’s deal failed to set out detailed steps for how countries will act on last year’s U.N. climate summit pledge to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity this decade. Some negotiators said Saudi Arabia had attempted to block such a plan during the talks.",
        "“There’s definitely a challenge in getting greater ambition when you’re negotiating with the Saudis,” said U.S. climate adviser John Podesta.",
        "The roster of countries required to contribute - about two dozen industrialised countries, including the U.S., European nations and Canada - dates back to a list decided during U.N. climate talks in 1992.",
        "European governments have demanded others pay in, including China, the world’s second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states. The deal encourages developing countries to make contributions but does not require them.",
        "The agreement includes a broader goal of raising $1.3 trillion in climate finance annually by 2035 - which would include funding from all public and private sources and which economists say matches the sum needed to address global warming.",
        "Countries also agreed on rules for a global market to buy and sell carbon credits that proponents say could mobilise billions more dollars into new projects to fight global warming, from reforestation to deployment of clean energy technologies.",
        "Securing the climate finance deal was a challenge from the start.",
        "Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory this month has raised doubts among some negotiators that the world’s largest economy would pay into any climate finance goal agreed in Baku. Trump, a Republican who takes office in January, has called climate change a hoax and promised to again remove the U.S. from international climate cooperation.",
        "President Joe Biden congratulated the COP29 participants for reaching what he called an historic agreement that would help mobilise needed funds, but said more work was needed.",
        "“While there is still substantial work ahead of us to achieve our climate goals, today’s outcome puts us one significant step closer. On behalf of the American people and future generations, we must continue to accelerate our work to keep a cleaner, safer, healthier planet within our grasp,” Biden said in a statement.",
        "Western governments have seen global warming slip down the list of national priorities amid surging geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and expanding conflict in the Middle East, and rising inflation.",
        "The showdown over financing for developing countries comes in a year scientists predict will be the hottest on record. Climate woes are stacking up, with widespread flooding killing thousands across Africa, deadly landslides burying villages in Asia, and drought in South America shrinking rivers.",
        "Developed countries have not been spared. Torrential rain triggered floods in Valencia, Spain, last month that left more than 200 dead, and the U.S. so far this year has registered 24 billion-dollar disasters - just four fewer than last year."

        "– Plastic waste accounts for about 10% of the waste collected by local authorities, out of which about 70% is packaging plastic such as single-use plastic (SUP) shopping bags (40%) and lunch sheets (10%) (Western Province, weight basis).",

In addition to PET, PP (polypropylene, such as plastic chairs, sorted e-waste, household items, etc.) and PE (polyethylene, such as HDPE bottles, polysacks, LDPE household containers, plastic bags, etc.) are largely recycled.",

        "The killing of civilians and other atrocities were widespread during the three-decade war mostly in the North and the East. The Sri Lankan armed forces, police and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are alleged to be responsible for many such massacres according to eye witnesses and circumstantial evidence. It’s rare that the Sri Lankan armed forces and police have been held accountable through domestic courts for such killings. Below are some observations and reflections on such a rare case, based on reading the case and talking to families of victims.",
        "Bharathipuram is a small village in the Trincomalee district in the Eastern Province. The police checkpoint in the village, run under the Kantale police, had come under attack on the night of January 31, 1998 till the early hours of February 1. There were no reports of injuries or fatalities to the police due to the attack. On February 1, 1998 morning, 8 persons, all male, including at least two teenage children, from the nearby village of Potkeni were abducted and later, their bodies were found near the checkpoint. The families said the abducted were taken away by the armed men in police uniform, but they had covered their faces and were not identifiable. Several family members stated that the police had good relations with villagers, including some of those killed. Below are those killed.",
        "Ponnambalam Kanagasaby,  Arumugam Segar,  Amirthalingam Surendran ,  Amirthalingam Gajendran ,Kunarathnam Sivarajah, Subramanium Kivakaran, Nagan Pachalanathan and Murugesu Jaganan",
        "One young woman was taken from her home by armed men, beaten and taken to the checkpoint where she was threatened that she would be shot dead. She had been accused of being part of the LTTE. Later, a senior police officer had ordered her release. She had seen one person being shot at the checkpoint who she had identified as Sivarajah, one of the 8 killed. She had also seen another body nearby which she had not been able to identify. She said she was able to identify one person who had abducted her and beat her in court.",
        "Nine years later in 2007, a brother of one of the victims was also found shot dead near a railway crossing at Pathinipuram, near the family home in Potkeni. According to the father, those responsible for the crime have not been held accountable.",
        "After some investigations by the Kantale police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the police, 13 policemen and home guards (also called village guards) were arrested. The Attorney General (AG) had filed charges against all the 13 in 2005. Indictments were based on the penal code and emergency regulations dealing with unlawful assembly and abduction to wrongfully and secretly detain and murder. In 2017, the AG withdrew the charges against 6 accused (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th) and the 7th accused was murdered. Hence, the trial was conducted in relation to 7 others accused.",
        "The names of the 8 persons killed, the day they were killed and the fact that they were killed by firearms were not disputed by the defence.",
        "Thirty-six witnesses were called by the prosecution and many testified to hearing gunfire throughout the night of 31st January and the early hours of the following day around the Bharathipuram checkpoint. One witness had testified that her brother and her brother-in-law who were abducted from the house and taken towards the checkpoint close to the house were later found dead. This was not challenged by the accused. Another witness had testified that 6 persons including the relatives and neighbours who were abducted by gunmen during a function in her house were later found dead. Another witness had testified that her son who had been abducted from a nearby house where he had gone for a function was later found dead. All of these were in the early hours of 1st February.",
        "A policeman had testified that he had seen 2 bodies in civilian clothing on the morning of 1st February inside the checkpoint and that he had also seen the 5th accused (Somarathna) there. But the court had decided to disregard his testimony citing contradictions in his previous statements to the police and the CID. Another policeman testified that he had seen the 2nd accused (Konara) bringing two civilians to the checkpoint and later were seen the 4th accused (Ranaraja Bandara) near those two civilians. He had said another person (not any of the accused) took the two persons behind the checkpoint and that he had later seen them dead. This testimony had not been challenged by the defence. Yet another policeman had testified that the 2nd, 4th and 8th accused (Medawela) were present at the checkpoint on that morning and were identified in court. He had also identified the 5th accused in court and testified that he had seen the 5th accused bringing two civilians to the checkpoint and that the two civilians were later taken behind the checkpoint by the 2nd accused. And that when he had gone behind the checkpoint, he had also seen the 4th accused in a nearby room with the two civilians on a mattress with their hands tied behind their backs. He also testified that he had seen the 1st accused (Chandrarathna) taking the two civilians outside and shooting them. This witness had been cross-examined by the defence, but his testimony narrated above had not been challenged. This witness  further testified that the 8th accused and some others had brought some more civilians to the checkpoint and that he had subsequently seen the dead bodies of three other civilians. A witness from the Civil Defence Force (CDF), had testified that he had seen some civilians near the checkpoint and that later, he had seen their dead bodies behind the checkpoint. This testimony too was also not challenged.",
        "The defence called 2 witnesses. One of them, Chief Inspector Silva’s testimony, along with the report of the Government analyst, indicated that firearms issued to the accused were not involved in the shooting and the prosecution also accepted this. The court noted that the testimony of the other defence witness, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Narampanawa didn’t in any way challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution.",
        "None of the 7 accused gave testimony on oath, but 6 of the accused made dock statements. There was no dock statement from the 1st accused who has been absconding from court. The 2nd accused had not denied he had brought two civilians from a nearby village to the checkpoint. The 4th accused had denied knowing about the incident, but the court had noted that he was a senior police officer (Inspector) in whose presence 8 civilians had been killed and he had some responsibility. The 5th accused had made a dock statement but not denied statements by witnesses that he had brought civilians to the checkpoint. The 8th accused had denied he was present in the vicinity of the checkpoint, but the court found that he had not challenged the testimony against him during the trial by witnesses except by saying it was due to personal animosity.",
        "The Government Analyst report indicated that the weapon that was used for the murder was a T-56 type weapon bearing number 1513631. It was confirmed during the trial that this weapon was issued to the Bharathipuram checkpoint. However, there was no indication to whom it was issued. The court noted that there was no evidence to prove that the weapon had been used by any of the accused in the case.",
        "On the 1st charge, being part of unlawful assembly to commit murder, the court had decided that the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 8th accused were guilty of unlawful assembly with intent to murder. Below are the names of the policemen found guilty;",
        "Kohonakoralalage Chandrarathna Bandara,  Konara Mudiyanselage Nihal Premasiri Konara,  Rajapaksa Muditanselage Ranaraja Bandara,  Yagama Liyanage Somarathna and Rateralalage Senarath Bandara Medawela",
        "The 2nd cluster of charges (charges 2–9) were related to the murder and the 3rd cluster of charges (charges 10–17) had been based on “common intention” as per Article 32 of the penal code. The court had decided to acquit all the accused as there was no adequate evidence. The 4th cluster of charges (charges 18-37) was about abductions. The court noted that though the prosecution had shown beyond reasonable doubt that the 2nd, 4th and 8th accused had brought civilians to the checkpoint, there was no evidence they had abducted the civilians from their homes. The court also noted that many relatives of the dead had given testimonies about them being abducted, but none had been able to identify any of the abductors. Thus, the court acquitted all the accused of these charges. A woman had identified the 6th accused in open court as being part of a group that abducted her, but the court noted that she had failed to identify him during an identification parade immediately after the incident, and acquitted the 6th accused as the prosecution was not able to show his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The 3rd accused was acquitted as there had been no evidence against him.",
        "According to the families, a compensation of Rs. 50,000 per person has been paid.",
        "The incident appears to be one of the many incidents of military and police targeting civilians after being targeted by the LTTE during the war in the North and the East. The approach of trying to label civilians killed as “LTTE” has also happened in this case, including an ASP acknowledging he had done this in a report to the court without any basis. The families were also threatened to sign documents saying the dead were LTTE members whom they had resisted.",
        "The case also followed a somewhat familiar pattern of cases in which the military and the police are accused of killing and causing enforced disappearances of Tamils, get transferred to areas outside the North and the East, which are predominantly Sinhalese. This has made it difficult for Tamil victims’ families to travel, obtain legal representation and follow the case as the court language is often in Sinhalese. In this case, the Tamil families of victims were keen to see the judgment, but it’s in Sinhalese.",
        "In examining the charges of murder, the court had accepted that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the 1st accused had shot two of the eight persons who had been killed. He was also acquitted of this charge. The court had determined the weapon used for the murder was issued to the Bharathipuram checkpoint, but there is no reference to the person in charge of the checkpoint in the judgment. However, the Court noted that the 4th accused was a senior officer (Inspector) who had not inquired into the purpose of bringing civilians to the checkpoint, not taken steps to ensure their security and kept silent till they were dead and that this indicated his intention was to have them killed.",
        "Some of the most significant testimonies that led to the conviction of five police officers and home guards came from policemen and a home guard.",
        "The conviction is only to 1 of 37 charges and those convicted were relatively junior officers and 26 years is a long time for families to wait for justice. But this rare judgment of holding policemen responsible for killing of Tamil civilians provides cautious hope that justice might be possible in some other similar cases too."

      "original_title": "Diego Garcia asylum seekers feel unsafe on remote British island territory",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "A group of asylum seekers including Sri Lankan nationals on an isolated British island territory have told UN investigators they feel unsafe and forgotten, as they reported sexual assaults and harassment of children, as well as self-harm and suicide attempts.",
        "Inspectors from the UN’s refugee agency visited Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to check on their welfare.",
        "A draft report says that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention.",
        "The Foreign Office said the island was not suitable for migrants to live on.",
        "Other than the migrant camp, the island is used as a UK-US military base. Thousands of troops are stationed there, usually on a one-year deployment, along with a smaller number of military contractors. For all allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers.",
        "Civilian visitors are not allowed - and the island has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK relocated all the people living there so it could develop the base.",
        "The 61 people currently in the island camp are mostly Sri Lankan Tamils and the first of them landed on Diego Garcia in October 2021 after their boat ran into trouble while trying to sail to Canada, according to migrants and officials.",
        "Their subsequent asylum claims were the first ever to be launched on British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) - an area described as being “constitutionally distinct and separate from the UK”, and where the UK government argues that the refugee convention does not apply.",
        "In its response to the UN report on the asylum seekers, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “BIOT is not a suitable location for migrants, which is why we have been working tirelessly to process the migrants’ claims for protection and to find a suitable third country for those whose claims are upheld.",
        "“At all times, the welfare and safety of migrants on BIOT has been our top priority.”",
        "UNHCR - the UN Refugee Agency - says the visit by its inspectors in late November marked the first time an “external party” had gained access to the island to monitor conditions there since the asylum seekers’ arrival. The draft report it produced following its visit was released to the BBC by the supreme court of BIOT.",
        "During its visit, UNHCR representatives heard several allegations of sexual assault and harassment, with alleged victims including young children. In all instances, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers, the report says.",
        "It adds that there was likely to be an “under-reporting” of sexual violence because of shame and stigma, and a view among asylum seekers that there would not be an effective response.",
        "“It was clear from speaking to asylum seekers, both the general population and those who had made allegations, that they did not see anything to be gained by reporting, both in terms of justice and safety, including due to the fact that alleged perpetrators of sexual assault remain living in the camp alongside alleged victims,” the report says.",
        "A decision made last July to designate family tents and single male tents was a “positive step” but “unlikely to be sufficient as a prevention mechanism”, it notes, adding that there was “little evidence of other preventive measures”.",
        "In the UN report, the asylum seekers on the island, which is hundreds of miles away from any other population, describe being bitten by rats in a fenced-off camp and say that they are only permitted to leave it under security escort, even if they just want to walk to the beach.",
        "That has led to feelings of despair and incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts, the UN’s draft report - one of the first detailed insights into conditions on the island - says.",
        "The group of asylum seekers, which includes 16 children, said they felt bored, depressed, and hopeless. Some said they felt “forgotten”, while one woman said: “Many of us think about ending our lives.”",
        "Some of the children told the inspectors they had witnessed violence and self-harm, and made multiple references to suicide during the UN visit, the draft report says.",
        "Some of them recalled a time when a security dog came to visit the camp and they watched it through the security fence.",
        "“The children said that it made them sad that the dog was able to be outside the fence and they were not,” the report says.",
        "The asylum seekers do not have access to the internet and have never met their lawyers in person. Until now, details of the conditions they are being held in have been scarce - recounted mainly in court hearings in the UK.",
        "A process has been established to determine if the group should be sent back to Sri Lanka or to a “safe third country”.",
        "The BBC last year established contact with multiple asylum seekers on the island, who described conditions there as hellish.",
        "UNHCR says it considers that the 61 Tamils on Diego Garcia are “subject to deprivation of liberty”.",
        "“They reside in a closed place with no possibility to leave at will, which amounts to detention under international law,” it explains.",
        "In its report, the UN agency says the conditions on the island “fail to provide the necessary standards of privacy, safety and dignity”.",
        "The draft report says asylum seekers are held in a fenced area of approximately 100m by 140m, and are barred from leaving unless with a security escort. Most of the children have never left the camp other than infrequent visits to the beach under security escort, the report says.",
        "The children showed UN representatives pictures they had drawn depicting the wired fence surrounding the camp and said their lives generally consisted of eating meals with their families, walking to the education tent for classes and then returning to their own tent.",
        "“Living here is like living in hell,” a mother is quoted as saying. “Children go to bed late and in [the] night do not sleep because they do not feel at peace. And that is because the children feel that we as parents are not at peace.”",
        "The asylum seekers are given three meals a day, and do not have the option to cook their own food. UNHCR observers found the meals to be varied and nutritional, but asylum seekers complained that the meals were sometimes not culturally appropriate, and that they had no say in what they ate.",
        "The UN report describes a deterioration in mental health in the camp, and observers saw signs of clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "The draft report says that while children in the camp appeared “playful and responsive” there were “worrying signs that living in an enclosed environment, in close proximity to adults who were suffering from poor mental health was having an impact on their emotional health”.",
        "“Children have witnessed violence and self-harm. They are aware that many of the adults, including in some cases their own parents, have tried to end their lives.”",
        "During the UN’s visit, one teenage girl asked a UNHCR representative: ‘“Do you think that if I kill myself, my brother and parents could go to another country where they would have a better life?”",
        "Asylum seekers, including children, told the UN “they often feel their suffering is without end, and frequently consider the idea of purposely inflicting bodily harm or ending their life”.",
        "Medical services on the island reported 21 incidents of self-harm between May and October 2023.",
        "“I feel I am alive on the outside but dead from inside. My body hurts me, and if the pains will further increase, I may have to hurt myself to end this all,” one man said.",
        "Several people have been transferred to Rwanda - a 3,000-mile flight away - for medical care following self-harm and suicide attempts.",
        "Those who have had their claims for international protection approved are still waiting for a third country - where they can have a new life - to be identified.",
        "UNHCR frequently heard concerns that asylum seekers felt they had been “forgotten” on the island and had “no way to speak up about their current conditions or perceived injustices”.",
        "The UN report acknowledges that the sudden arrival of asylum seekers on Diego Garcia presented “enormous challenges” and says “important efforts were pursued to ensure that those who wished to make international protection claims were able to do so” and that services such as medical care were made available. But, it says, the “existing situation is not tenable”.",
        "Its draft report calls for the asylum seekers to be “urgently relocated”, for final decisions on international protection to be expedited, and solutions secured for those whose claims are approved.",
        "It also calls for the UK government to conduct “contingency planning” for possible future arrivals on the island, and for an independent mechanism to be established to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers.",
        "One of the group’s lawyers, Tessa Gregory, from London firm Leigh Day, said she was “extremely concerned” about their wellbeing, describing conditions on the island as “appalling”.",
        "Lawyers had been denied access to visit their clients on the island, she added.",
        "The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the base.",
        "Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains the islands are its own and the UN’s’ highest court has ruled that the UK’s administration of the territory is “unlawful” and must end. UNHCR says its visit to the island does not constitute recognition of BIOT."

      "original_title": "A fifth-year accolade: In precious memory of Dr Sarojini Perera",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "Today, we commemorate the fifth anniversary of my eternally cherished wife Dr Malwattage Josephine Sarojini Perera (nee Peeris) leaving this mortal world. It has been five years of intense desolation and loneliness for all of us in the family, as well as our friends since she left this planet Earth. However, the memories of her life remain vivid; her ever-present spirit is so much with us, and her heritage is eternally enduring. She was ever so beautiful in her physical profile as much as from deep within the interior of her human form. She was not merely a remarkable individual, but a dazzling beacon of compassion, an embodiment of love, and an eternal source of inspiration for those fortunate enough to cross paths with her.",
        "Sarojini was a woman of extraordinary grace and kindness, whose ever-so-radiant smile regularly and persistently illuminated the lives of those around her. As it goes in the song Candida, “Stars would not come out if she was around as they could not even match the glow of that wonderful smile.” Her inner beauty shone brightly, mirroring the purity of her soul, just through that beaming smile. Shakespeare aptly wrote in Antony and Cleopatra, “Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.” Indeed, Sarojini was the epitome of an immeasurable variety of virtues; compassion, empathy, resilience, love, and unwavering dedication to her calling. She was a gift to humanity from the Good Lord above for a fantastic lifetime of 72 years 2 months and 11 days; a phenomenal journey of sparkling splendour.",
        "Throughout her life, she exemplified the essence of service, devoting herself wholeheartedly to all of us in her immediate family, as well as those in her extended family, all her relatives and friends and not least of all, her patients. For all of them, she was the essence of the abiding power of hope. Her chosen path led her to work tirelessly with individuals afflicted and affected by HIV and AIDS; a population marginalised and stigmatised very often, by society. Yet, this lady of ours approached her work with boundless empathy and a profound sense of humane care. She was the personification of a very clear understanding that behind every diagnosis was a person who deserved dignity, respect, and affection.",
        "As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, “To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man”, the lady remained true to her principles, steadfast in her commitment to alleviate suffering and foster understanding. Her patients were not just recipients of medical care; they were embraced by her as members of her extended family. Sarojini’s gentle demeanour and compassionate nature endeared her to all who sought solace in her indulgence. She provided not only medical treatment but also emotional support, serving as a beacon of hope in times of utter darkness and despair for those who sought her help. In the words of Shakespeare from Romeo and Juliet, “Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs……,” and indeed in her case, Sarojini’s love emanated as a healing balm, comforting the souls of those sighing in terrible anguish.",
        "Beyond her professional endeavours, Sarojini was a loving wife, a devoted mother, and a precious friend. Our home was a sanctuary of warmth and affection, where love flourished, and laughter filled the air. She nurtured her family with boundless fondness, instilling in them the precious values of kindness, integrity, and resilience. She would remain calm even through grave adversities and take steps to settle even the disturbed. Her love continues to live on in the hearts of her family, a timeless bond that even transcends the bounds of mortality and impermanence of life.",
        "As we reflect on Sarojini’s remarkable life and the bequest she left behind, we try ever so hard, not to dwell on the sadness of her absence but instead celebrate the beauty of her existence. Of course, we miss her terribly. She may have left this mortal world, but her spirit remains eternally intertwined with ours, guiding us with her wisdom and inspiring us with her grace. Sarojini’s life was a testament to the power of eternal love, compassion, and service; a gift that continues to illuminate our path and enrich our lives.",
        "Real beauty is not only what the eyes can behold but also what the heart can hold. What we see with our eyes will vanish someday, but what we store in our hearts will forever stay. Many people, myself included, have tried ever so hard to use many adjectives and descriptive exaltations to portray this wonderful person that was Sarojini. Yet for all that, we could write reams on her but even through such an endeavour, we will never be able to paint a realistic picture that would describe her even in a million words. As for me, I had the singular privilege of holding the most gorgeous lady in my arms for all those lovely years from courtship to her ultimate demise. Yet for all that, memories are forever and I will always remember her life on earth as a beautiful melody that would never fade and would linger on forever.",
        "We do try our best to honour Sarojini’s memory by embodying the virtues she so wonderfully and effortlessly exemplified; compassion, humane kindness, unbridled love, and steadfast dedication to serving others. That is of crucial significance to all of us as they have thrown away the mould in which she was made and that is what makes her uniqueness to be a vision of intense grandeur. Though she may no longer walk amongst us, her essence remains, alive in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing her. As the great bard wrote in The Twelfth Night, “In my stars, I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Dr Sarojini Perera had greatness thrust upon her as a result of her selfless deeds and her profound impact on the lives of those she touched.",
        "Darling Sara, your eternal legacy will go far beyond your time with us. Your greatest victory in life was to have been such a wonderful, lovely and caring person. It has been said that every smile, every loving word and every kind action, is a reflection of the beauty of a soul. In your case, that beauty was so unique, it was so much you. You will always be the epitome of that citation as the ripples of your life will continue to be nurtured in the hearts and souls of all who had the superlative fortune and the superlative privilege to come into contact with you.",
        "May your heritage continue to inspire us to live with love, compassion, and integrity while honouring your memory with every act of kindness and every moment of grace. We do believe that you, the Queen of our Hearts, so safe now in the kingdom of your creator, are looking down on us through your eternally benevolent eyes and guiding us through our sojourn on Mother Earth.",

        "Since then, the health sector employees’ trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the government’s decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees.",
        "Later, on January 23, the government decided to temporarily half the payment of DAT allowance for doctors citing insufficient funds. Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stated that although the necessary arrangements were made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury had not provided funds within the approved allocation limit.",
        "This prompted the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to announce the launch of an indefinite strike action starting January 24. However, it was later called off the planned trade union action, after the decision to suspend the DAT allowance payments was rolled back."

The initial complaint pertains to the Range Rover vehicle previously associated with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and its transfer to Piumi Hansamali. This vehicle is estimated to be worth Rs. 100 million. Questions arise regarding how the vehicle came into Piumi Hansamali's possession, the reasons behind its transfer and how she could afford such a valuable asset while primarily engaged in selling cosmetics. Additionally, it is noted that Piumi Hansamali's has not made any television appearances lately.",

        "“The next steps on the debt restructuring are indeed to conclude negotiations with external commercial creditors and to implement agreements in principle with the official creditors.",
        "“The domestic debt operations are largely completed. Debt restructuring discussions are continuing.”",
        "Sri Lanka regained monetary stability around and inflation, as measured by the island’s Consumer Price Index stopped its tracks.",
        "Since then, private companies have largely been engaged in deleveraging and the central bank has, in general runn deflationary policy to build reserves (selling sterilization securities into banks).",
        "Going against past practice, the central bank has also allowed the rupee to appreciate, while collecting reserves through an ad hoc pegging mechanism (under a clean float reserve collection is not possible).",
        "The central bank has so far not cut rates and enforced them by printing money on the claim that historical 12-month inflation is low (flexible inflation targeting), real interest rates are high (a frequent claim made by inflationists re-stating the same doctrine in a different way), or that there is a potential output gap that can be bridged by printing money.",
        "All rate falls so far has been done through actual domestic credit developments and the confidence created by the central bank itself by maintaining monetary stability, and the not engaging restructuring all domestic debt and spooking all government securities buyers.",
        "Sri Lanka’s monetary operating framework, which has since legalized in a new law, is likely to lead to external instability in the future, as soon as private credit recovers, analysts have warned.",
        "In a series of currency crises since the end of the war the central bank has printed money saying inflation was low and busted the currency through ‘exchange rate as a first line of defence’ to avoid market pricing rates, critics say.",
        "The IMF’s ‘reserve adequacy metrics’ and the ‘exchange rate as a first line of defence’ are directly contradictory doctrines, which are in collision course whenever short or long term rates are enforced with overnight term, outright injections or non-penal rate standing facilities, critics have said.

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The ongoing nationwide drug bust, called Yukthiya or Justice, continues to yield sizeable quantities of narcotics daily, and the drug distribution networks have reportedly suffered major setbacks. Many substance-dependent individuals are said to be going through the agony of withdrawal, which, in some cases, could be so intense as to drive the sufferers to suicide. The police are said to be sending them to rehabilitation centres.",
        "Operation Yukthiya must go on until its goal is achieved. The country must be rid of the drug menace, and narcotics dealers who prey on the youth and children must be hunted down. Let that be the bottom line. The police deserve public assistance although the ongoing operation is not totally devoid of politics. They have already drawn severe criticism even from those who have welcomed action being taken to cleanse the country of narcotics and crimes.",
        "Among its critics is former Minister Champika Ranawaka, who has said children become destitute when their parents are arrested and remanded over drug-related offences. The police also stand accused of committing excesses in the name of neutralising the drug Mafia; the recent demolition of a hotel believed to have been constructed with drug money is a case in point.",
        "All unauthorised constructions on beaches and other environmentally-sensitive areas such as wetlands, river banks, forests and the catchment zones of irrigation tanks, have to be pulled down. But those who carry out this task have to act impartially and fairly; no room must be left for selectivity and discrimination.",
        "The police had better tread cautiously lest their lapses and excesses should be leveraged by the opponents of the ongoing offensive against the underworld to turn public opinion against them. It is hoped that the police will care to make appropriate guardianship arrangements for the benefit of the children whose parents are arrested.",
        "It behoves the police to be responsive to criticism and mend their ways. That is the best way to silence their critics and ensure the continuity of Operation Yukthiya. Drug barons have huge slush funds, which can be utilised to carry out social media offensives against the drug busters and influence politicians, who do not scruple to serve the interests of anti-social elements.",
        "As we argued in a previous editorial comment, the on-gong land-based drug eradication campaign has to be coupled with naval operations against drug smugglers’ maritime arm. There is irrefutable evidence that drug dealers use local fishing craft, especially trawlers, to smuggle in narcotics. Bloody turf wars among the owners of drug-smuggling vessels are frequent, and some of them have lasted for decades, especially along the southern littoral.",
        "On Thursday night, the Navy and the Police Narcotics Bureau, in a joint operation, seized a huge stock of heroin and crystal methamphetamine commonly known as ICE, weighing about 300 kilos. It was concealed in a multi-day fishing craft. Six suspects were taken into custody. The vessel was brought to the Galle Port yesterday. In 2023 alone, the Sri Lanka Navy seized 715 kilos of heroin, 11 kilos of ICE, 140 kilos of hashish, 3,711 kilos of Kerala cannabis and 50 kilos of locally-grown cannabis.",
        "This shows that the government has to intensify its focus on the sea routes used by drug smugglers while battling the narcotics dealers on the land. There is a pressing need to surveil all fishing craft and fisheries harbours. All necessary resources, including personnel, must be made available to the Navy, the Coast Guard and the police to step up anti-narcotics operations at sea and on beaches.",
        "That will be half the battle in breaking the back of the drug problem. The general consensus is that most of the narcotics brought into the country through the Colombo Port go undetected due to corruption among politicians, port workers and the Customs personnel. If action is taken to ensure that each and every freight container is properly checked before being released, drug smuggling can be tackled effectively.",

In 1967, he passed his Advanced Level Examination with top honors and entered University.",

He made a great contribution to the parry to spread its tentacles nationwide. He was also a unique character among the talented orators that the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party had.

Every year, the summit is visited by multitudes of devotees from various faiths and cultures from across the world.",
        "Declared a Wildlife Nature Reserve as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its significant ecosystem and historical background, Sri Pada has captured global attention as a biodiversity hotspot for centuries. The reserve forms numerous headwaters in the territory, and is home to a vast number of animal and plant species including those highly vulnerable to extinction at present.",
        "Today, millions of pilgrims and sightseers travel through the forested route during the pilgrimage season, posing a threat to the survival and conservation of the reserve. Environmentalists constantly raise awareness on the effects of littering the pilgrimage site with tons of non-biodegradable polythene and plastic items. In spite of imposing penalties, the many attempts by governmental and private entities to facilitate convenient segregation of waste along the route, or the many dialogues initiated on social media, it remains a growing problem. Worshippers continue to discard polythene bags, PET bottles and food wrappers, especially in areas such as “Seetha Gangula” and “Indikatupana” where they perform traditional observances prior to beginning their journey.",
        "In an effort to find solutions ahead of World Environment Day 2024, leading finance company Siyapatha Finance PLC, through “Siyapathen Mihikathata”, its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) pillar focusing on environmental conservation, set in motion its first step to conserve this wildlife sanctuary for the generations to come, under the theme of “Nemadumen Pasu Amaduma”.",
        "Having obtained special permission from Nuwara Eliya District Secretary Mr. Nandana Galaboda, over 50 members of staff as well as the senior Management from Siyapatha’s Head Office, together with officials from Central Environmental Authority’s (CEA) Nuwara Eliya Office, joined hands to kick off the Sri Pada Cleaning Project. Displaying commitment to the objective of “Siyapathen Mihikathata”, Siyapatha staff collected close to a ton of plastic, polythene and other waste, which were then sent for recycling.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "Ven Mettavihari, who resides in the Narada Bauddha Dharmayatanaya, formerly the Narada Buddhist Research and Information Centre down Sarana Road, Colombo 7, is the advisor to the Brahm Society of Sri Lanka. They are preparing a visit from Ajahn Brahm to Sri Lanka in May 2025.",
        "Ven Mettavihari sent me a verbatim transcription of a talk given by Ven Brahmavamso. Impressed and finding it useful in my attempts to meditate, I decided to redo the article and share it with others in this season of  Unduvap Poya. I will give Ajahn Brahm’s actual words within speech punctuation, attempting to retain the ‘flavour’ of his style of preaching. I may not succeed in this but his messages will be conveyed.",
        "“Meditation is learning how to just simply relax the mind but sometimes people misunderstand what meditation is. They try very hard; they try to achieve something; get rid of things and that very trying is the opposite of meditation. When you try to direct your body to do something, you cannot let it do things on its own. When I teach meditation today, sing on how to relax the body and using exactly the same methods to relax your mind, that is Buddhist mediation. It’s not about concentration. That is a very unfortunate translation or rather, mistranslation of the Buddhist term Samadi. It is about stillness, relaxation, and peace that we aim at.”",
        "I now listen to Ajahn Brahmali’s talks on YouTube; he being a devoted pupil of Ajahn Brahm. Ajahn Brahmali gives the same advice. He says that when you are prepared for meditation with correct posture on a cushion or chair and in a suitable place, you relax your body and mind, while of course being fully awake and straight. He says the body will take over and if all is correct, you will get absorbed in your in-and-out breathing or other object you decide to focus your attention on. Ajahn Brahm gives the same advice about posture etc and adds: “You do not get extra points for sitting on the floor.” Ease, comfort, relaxation are all important",
        "Ven Brahm goes a step further. “Now able to take that relaxation deeper, you do need to be very aware of your body. Simple mindfulness. At the beginning that awareness of your body is just very superficial. When it gets strong enough by itself, you actually start to perceive tensions and tight spots in your body. You learn to relax those spots. It’s like looking at your speed gauge when driving. This gauge of mindfulness will indicate to you whether you are tensing more or getting relaxed. With the feedback given, you relax more and more until you feel really relaxed. You then start to experience what I call  delight in relaxation.”",
        "Then comes one of his real life similes. “You may think this a mere technique but as your relaxed meditation increases you recognize the happiness, the delight, the sheer joy of these states of relaxation. People spend thousands of dollars going to Bali to sit on a chair near the ocean and get relaxation. But you achieve this with no hassle of airports, flight delays, losing baggage and great spending.",
        "“This is what I want you to start perceiving, noticing your body relaxing. If you notice delight in it, a strange thing happens: the relaxing goes deeper. Experiencing delight the mind wants more, so you relax to the maximum until your body feels continuous delight. The duration of your delight varies, depending on situation, time of year, day, your wellbeing. So no fixed rules; you adapt. That’s what mindfulness does; gives you feedback and you relax.”",
        "He then deals with obstacles like an unfortunate incident that morning, or someone being nasty to you. “You find it difficult to get the ache out of your body, just saying ‘get out’ will not help. You have to deal with this, tend it, care for your mind and with kindness, induce relaxation. The body will relax, the mind will follow. Awareness is not enough, we need to add these other wonderful qualities: compassion, kindness, softness.",
        "“When you are kind to something, you find there is a softening. If it is a memory of the past, kindness will soften your mind and the hurt or pain or resentment will vanish. In the same way you may be worried about the future. Maybe your biopsy result will be given you the next day or your kid is facing a tough exam which affects his future. You cannot force the thought out of your mind nor not take notice. Accept it and like an ache in the body, loosen it. Be kind to your mind dwelling on the future, soften it and the pain too will disappear.”",
        "We all who try to meditate know how thoughts come to the mind and upset our relaxation and one-pointedness. Ajahn Brahm advises getting away from past and present by relaxing, relax with the now – dwell on the present moment. “As I say, be a friend to the present moment. Don’t be an owner, controller, boss. Don’t be a mind control freak. Be a friend, have a relationship of friendliness with your mental world, you’ve lived with it your whole life.”",
        "He then touches on the Buddhist concept of rebirth and suggests we have gone through many lives with this same mind. So we are stuck with our minds. Thus we’d better learn to be kind to it, no escape from the mind. This was a concept that came to me worded simply by Ajahn Brahmali, who says when we die we take our minds with us to the next birth. We’ve been told we take the  chuthi sitha, which Sampath the three wheeler driver who spins me around explains as – chuthi means leaves. Using the term ‘mind departing’ explains rebirth in a friendlier manner to me.",
        "Ajahn Brahm brings in a personal anecdote here. He says that when teaching meditation if he was boring, the minds of the people listening would wander. If he were kind and concerned, they sense it. It becomes obvious. He thus introduces kindness and concern and shares it with the people who he preaches to. “Treat your minds with some respect, some kindness, some care. You will become more aware, your mindfulness increases. It’s like awakening in the morning and sensing more around you. It is the awakened one from the world  Pujati – to wake up.",
        "“The stronger your mindfulness, the happier you feel. And as you remain still in the present moment a long time, wow, your happiness gets off the scale. That is the result of being mindful and kind. Here we go. So close your eyes and decide not to fight. Not fighting with our body or mind but learning to be at peace with both.”",
        "He is considerate, too, about our human frailties. He advices: “If you want to adjust your body, wiggle your bottom, have a scratch, a nose blow, please do it out of respect for your bodily peace. Once that coarse relaxation of the body through bodily movement is complete, now relax the body even further. If you feel any tension or irritation be fully aware of it. Do not try to get rid of it. Like a barking dog if you try to chase it, it will come at you and bite! What is the mind attitude that sent to your body gives relief? By watching the dial of mindfulness, you’ll find it is kindness, love, acceptance, embracing, caring which relaxed your body deeper and deeper. Just as a mother comforts her child when it is sick and takes away the pain, be aware of the delight of relaxation.”",
        "“All the problems of the past or the future, be kind to them, soften them. See if you can do the same with your mental world, relaxing it until all that is left is this moment called now. Look at it as your best friend. Don’t try to hold this moment with force, don’t use will power, use kindness.”",
        "I am sure you readers will agree it all sounds very easy while meditation is not easy. The crux of Ajahn Brahm’s advice is to make it as easy and pleasurable as possible and the key is relaxation of both body and mind.",
        "Enough of the old Buddhism we followed of rites, rituals and rigidity. Here is what we really need to do to follow the Buddha’s teaching and get on the Path he showed all humanity, which leads ultimately to deliverance from suffering.",

        "My mother superstitiously told me, when I was about five years old, that I had two whorls on my head/hair (in Tamil ‘rettechuli’) and that therefore I should be careful of water and drowning. She did not allow me to swim in the sea. However, even in my student days, I realized that I had a love of water – lakes, lagoons or seas. It had its dangers too, as my mother’s superstitions seemed to prove. I relate three cases of my brushes with death by drowning.",
        "I was boarded at the Royal College boarding when the whole of Royal College, including the boarding, was taken over by the British Army during World War II. I was forced to go into private boarding houses that happened to be down lanes by the sea. As for school, we had to share the University building with its students, leaving the mornings entirely free for me. Fortunately, I lived near the beach at Kinross Avenue, which gave me the opportunity to swim every day. I thus became a good swimmer by the age of 14, unbeknownst to my parents, who were posted in distant provinces.",
        "The sea at Kinross Avenue had a raft with a diving board about halfway to the reef, which was about 300 yards from the shore. I had never swum to the raft; but one day I managed to swim past it. As the reef was near, I dared myself to swim to it. Having reached the reef (an achievement for me at that time), I challenged myself to swim past it to the open sea! I had hardly gone 20 yards beyond the reef, when I suffered a severe cramp in my right leg. My leg doubled up in pain and my body arched in two. I could not swim, I could not float: I struggled with both arms flailing, but I was going down. There was no use shouting because there was no one near me. I did not shout for help although I knew that I was going to drown – because I knew that it was my own fault. I went down twice, struggling for breath, for life.",
        "Fortunately, a senior at Royal College (Basil Mendis) had seen me, a small boy, swimming to the reef alone. When I crossed the reef, he got alarmed – and watched me closely. When I went down, he shouted desperately to the best swimmers on the raft for help. Thank God, the raft was well positioned and that there was a life-saver on it! He dived off the raft, crossed the reef and reached me – just in time! He held me up physically and curtly ordered me to lie on my back. He held my head with both hands, with his body beneath me and used the back-stroke kick to safely bring me back to the shore – to the applause of the small crowd on the beach. I thanked him to the extent possible while vomiting water from my stomach and lungs.",
        "Years later, while still working in Rome, I happened to be in Sri Lanka on vacation. When I was at the cinema, I saw the man who had saved my life. I recognized him because of his tall athletic build. He left his seat during the interval to go to the bar: I hurried after him. I reminded him how he had saved my life 40 years ago. I found out that his name was ‘Sirimanne’. I bought him a drink and we chatted for a while. It was regrettably brief, with the man who had saved my life 40 years ago.",
        "In the second case where I nearly drowned, there was reversal of roles. Whereas I, the life-saver in this case was 22 years old, while the boy that I managed to save was about 14 years old – a strange reversal of roles. The similarity ends there: I had no training or experience in life-saving, whereas the boy I tried to save clung on to me till I almost drowned.",
        "At that time, I was already working as an Asst. Lecturer in the University, living down Schofield Place by the sea. This gave me the chance to swim in the sea most mornings before going to work. One morning when I went for a swim, there were many on the beach. Among them was a batch of schoolboys about 14 years of age playing in chest-deep water, probably not knowing how to swim. I set about my purpose determinedly – which was to swim to the reef and back, although I was not very fit at that time. I managed to reach the reef, which was about 300 yards from the shore. I turned to swim back. I was halfway to the shore when I heard shouts of ‘Help, Help’! The cries were from the group of boys: one of them had been carried out by the current and was drowning.",
        "The cries came from far to one side, which would have involved my swimming an extra 150 yards. I was unfit and doubted my ability to swim that extra distance. The cries got more urgent and desperate. There were no swimmers out there: so I had to save the boy, or he would die. It was a difficult decision to make: I was already too tired to try. Against my better judgment, knowing nothing about life-saving, I swam to save the boy. But as soon as I reached him, he clung on to me, pinioning both my arms, so that we both went down. I struggled to extricate myself, trying to come up for one last breath, but he continued to hold me down. I somehow managed to free one arm: I punched him in the jaw with all my might. With that, I was able to free myself and come up to breathe. Since there was nothing that I could do to save him, I tried to swim away; but I could not let him drown: so I turned back.",
        "Again the boy clutched me with both arms, bringing me down. This time I consciously hit him hard on the jaw so that he recoiled, letting me go free. By this time we were near the shore: but I had no strength to go on. I remember that the boy was very fair, a Burgher boy.",
        "I also remember that he was wearing khaki shorts with a white cloth belt that was trailing in the water. I knew that if I went near him, his grasp would lead to my death. Fortunately, underwater, I saw a huge wave come sweeping towards the shore. Keeping him at a good distance, I caught his trailing white belt. As the wave crested, I launched him in its path with all my might – to reach the outstretched arms of his friends.",
        "It did not end there for me, however: I still had to reach the shore. All my strength had ebbed. By this time, I was almost vertical in the water, not able to swim even one stroke. I had to wait for the next wave to wash me to the shore. All the boys gathered around to thank me. While they went joyfully home, I lay retching on the beach for almost one hour.",
        "I realized that I was a ‘water man’. I actively sought a lake near Rome, where I lived. I was lucky to find a fresh-water lake, only one hour’s drive away, Lake Bracciano (Lago di Bracciano). It was a very large lake, more than 800 feet deep.",
        "I rented a piece of land on the lake and kept a sailboat there. I had never taken sailing lessons; but this did not deter me from sailing. One Sunday afternoon in early spring-time, I set sail with the wind at my back. I had little control over direction, going ‘where the wind listeth’.",
        "I loved to hear the hiss of water at my bow, the whip of the wind in my sails and the gurgle of water in my wake. After some time, I realized that I had come a long way and was in the middle of the lake, about two miles from the shore, and distant from any boat. I decided to turn back. I knew in theory how to turn, but somehow my boat capsized in the strong wind.",
        "Fortunately, I was a good swimmer, but the water was very, very cold in the middle of the lake in early spring. I was able to cling to the boat, which floated because of the air trapped underneath. I had not bothered to put on my life-jacket. Hoping that it would be trapped under the boat, I dived repeatedly for it – and found it.",
        "I noticed for the first time that there was a whistle attached to it – which subsequently saved my life. I did not know how long I could keep my hold on the boat: meanwhile, I had to keep moving because the water was freezing. Although it was afternoon now, I knew that when night came, I would surely drown because my freezing fingers would lose their grip on the boat. I could not be seen by anyone, since I was in the middle of the lake. There was no hope!",
        "Fortunately it was a Sunday – and there was a regatta on the lake. However, the boats had a set course and would never come near me. I had capsized in the middle of the lake – and nobody would see me! I saw a buoy perhaps one mile away from me, around which the boats had to turn to sail to the winning post. If only I could get to within hearing-distance of that buoy, perhaps someone would hear me or see me, before nightfall. I had to be rescued before nightfall or I would surely die.",
        "My only hope was to swim to near the buoy. I had to swim with one hand while pulling the boat with the other, knowing full well that I had to pull the mast and sail under the water too. It was a struggle; but I knew that the alternative was a watery death. So I struggled and struggled, pulling the boat with alternating arms: I must have taken two hours to get near that buoy.",
        "Whenever a boat rounded the buoy, I would blow the whistle with all my might – but to no avail. I was probably too far away from the buoy, while the wind was also against me. So I struggled to get closer to the buoy: even so, with the sound of the wind when they turned, successive boats never heard me. Desperate now, I came up with a new strategy: I needed to sound the whistle just as they turned the tiller and before the sound of the wind filled their sails; otherwise they would never hear me.",
        "By this time, there were only stragglers left in the race. I lay in wait for a straggler: when one came, I blew my whistle desperately, but just at the correct moment. Thank God, they heard me! The crew had to abandon the race in order to rescue me. They were two French girls: they pulled me into their boat, thus saving me from certain death. They decided to save my boat too: they tied my overturned boat to theirs and towed it along, with the sails under the water too.",
        "There could not have been a better ending to my escapade. I thanked the girls profusely in my broken French and regretted that they had to give up their race in order to save me. I limped home, none the worse for wear. Fortunately, my wife was not in Rome to hear of my misadventure!",
        "Perhaps my mother’s superstition about drowning was almost true. Or perhaps I was working too hard (courting drowning experiences) to make it come true!",

        "Sampanthan could never overlook the ethnic divisions that have plagued Sri Lanka for decades – before, during and after the war",
        "Sampanthan, one among the few TNA leaders who Western diplomats in Colombo continued to respect despite his political predicament, tried to come on to his own after the LTTE was militarily crushed. Now minus the armed campaign to break up Sri Lanka, the TNA leader made some bold statements, making it clear that he wanted to be a part of the island nation. A section of the TNA, which fragmented over the years, sided with him. After the war, he played a major role in highlighting internationally the horrific price the ordinary Tamils had to pay in Sri Lanka simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time",
        "Sri Lankan Tamil political leader Rajavarothiyam Sampanthan, who died on 30 June at age 91, emerged as the most prominent Tamil face in the island nation after the decimation of the Tamil Tigers. But his later moderate voice and readiness to accept a united Sri Lanka were forever marred by the long years he paid homage to the LTTE’s nihilist politics, seriously jeopardising a long and tumultuous political career that began in the 1960s.",
        "Elected for the first time to the Sri Lankan Parliament in 1977 as a front-ranking member of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), then the most popular party in the Tamil community, Sampanthan saw several ups and downs before becoming the main opposition leader in Parliament in 2015. This was six years after the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran, founder leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sampanthan held the coveted post, only the second Tamil to do so, for three years.",
        "But it was in 2001 when he, as the senior most Tamil politician, came to head the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a grouping of diverse political parties including some which once were part of the armed campaign to carve out an independent Tamil Eelam. But those who thought that the TNA would probably be to the LTTE what the Sinn Fein was to the Irish Republican Party (IRA) were soon disappointed.",
        "The LTTE was then at the peak of its glory and was widely seen, including by sections of the Sri Lankan military, as an armed force which could never be crushed. Indeed, the next year, in 2002, a desperate Colombo signed with the LTTE a ceasefire agreement as part of an international peace process driven by Norway. Unlike the IRA, the LTTE did not want anyone, Tamil politicians sympathetic to it included, to share the political limelight.",
        "In the process, the TNA surrendered wholesale to the LTTE, formally declaring the Tamil Tigers as the sole representative of the Tamil community. It did not matter that men like Sampanthan were in politics when Prabhakaran was still a teenager and had entered Parliament when the LTTE chief was a virtual nobody. In that instant, the TNA became a second-class appendage to the LTTE, losing respect not only among the mass of the Tamil people but also in Colombo as well as internationally. Country after country came to view the TNA as a pitiable extension of the LTTE, which New Delhi banned in 1992, a year after a suicide bomber blew up former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
        "The 2002 truce collapsed within years, triggering the last and the bloodiest rounds of Eelam War, resulting in the wholesale destruction in 2009 of the LTTE and its entire leadership besides the surrender by thousands of Tamil Tiger fighters.",
        "From 2001 to 2009, the TNA led by Sampanthan, who in earlier times spent long years in Tamil Nadu, kept a steady chant against the military excesses in Sri Lanka and highlighted the suffering of the Tamil civilians in the war. But it kept mum on the many excesses of the LTTE including its decision not to allow tens of thousands of ordinary Tamils, women and children included, to leave its zone in northern Sri Lanka even as the military menacingly advanced. In the eventuality, tens of thousands of civilians died in the end stages of the 25-year-long conflict.",
        "Whatever may have been Sampanthan’s intentions, many who had known him could not understand how he could bow to the LTTE, fully knowing that it cold-bloodedly assassinated his own leader, A. Amirthalingam, and a colleague, V. Yogeswaran. Both men were stalwarts of the moderate TULF, Sampanthan’s party. Not just this. The LTTE often treated Sampanthan shabbily without caring for his age as well as political seniority.",
        "No wonder, Sampanthan sounded often confused as he appeared to be travelling in two boats at the same time. He could not justify Amirthalingam’s cowardly killing yet he would not denounce it beyond a point; he was not comfortable with the LTTE but had to support it and its leader Prabhakaran; he wanted to be a part of Sri Lanka’s mainstream politics but could not denounce the Tamil separatist campaign; he would have been happy with a political end to the Tamil grievances but he could not tell that to the Tamil Tigers. Without his wanting it, Sampanthan ended up being a prisoner of the negative politics the LTTE hoisted on the Tamils, making everyone in the minority community its virtual prisoner; the dissenters were dubbed “traitors” and done to death.",
        "Sampanthan, one among the few TNA leaders who Western diplomats in Colombo continued to respect despite his political predicament, tried to come on to his own after the LTTE was militarily crushed. Now minus the armed campaign to break up Sri Lanka, the TNA leader made some bold statements, making it clear that he wanted to be a part of the island nation. A section of the TNA, which fragmented over the years, sided with him. After the war, he played a major role in highlighting internationally the horrific price the ordinary Tamils had to pay in Sri Lanka simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
        "The normally suave Sampanthan once lost his cool with a Tamil journalist over the Sri Lankan national flag, which sections of Tamils do not accept. Sampanthan made it clear that he very much respected the flag and that it was his duty as a mainstream politician to respect it. “I belong to Sri Lanka. Not to any other country,” he thundered. Sampanthan was combative and accused the journalist of raising needless questions simply to keep the country divided on ethnic lines.",
        "The contradictions never deserted him even as he lay ill in Colombo. Amid a looming Presidential election in Sri Lanka, Tamil political parties are divided on what to do: support one of the main Sinhalese presidential candidates or put up a Tamil candidate for whatever the worth or boycott the elections, like in 2005. Sampanthan was reportedly in favour of backing incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe, the man who long years ago signed a peace pact with the LTTE. But before he could announce a decision, Sampanthan passed away, marking the end of an era in Sri Lanka’s Tamil politics",
        "Yet, Sampanthan could never overlook the ethnic divisions that have plagued Sri Lanka for decades – before, during and after the war. Anura Dissanayake, leader of the leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), recently told an audience in London that Sampanthan one day clasped his hands in Parliament and said in visible despair: “I want to shout loudly that I am a Sri Lankan. But I am not able to do it because we (Tamils) are not treated fairly.”",

        "Around 25,000 people are employed in the paramedic services sector and trade unions affirm that they are working for  a pittance",
        "Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has questioned trade unions on the demands that they made prior to launching strike action",
        "On Tuesday (January 9), staffers in the paramedic services launched an unannounced token strike that crippled the country’s already ailing healthcare sector. The strike was launched in wake of the government approving to double the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 70,000, but refused the same for technicians, laboratory workers and other staffers employed in the paramedic services sector. As a result public health inspectors (PHIs), public health midwives, ophthalmic technicians, laboratory technicians and employees in several other sectors later announced that they would continue strike action for another 48 hours with effect from Tuesday demanding the government to approve a Rs. 35,000 allowance for them as well.",
        "“It has been six months since we requested authorities to increase the fuel allowance of Rs. 1200 that is being provided to employees in the paramedic services,” said PHI Union President Upul Rohana. “Hospital staff has complained of lapses in transport facilities. The DAT allowance provided for the paramedic services staff is only Rs. 3000. Therefore it is unfair that the government approved an allowance only for the doctors,” he added.",
        "Around 25,000 people are employed in the paramedic services sector and according to the trade unions, they have been working for a pittance. “We thought it wouldn’t be appropriate to launch trade union action as the government was facing an economic crisis. But it now looks like the government indeed has money and therefore we too are demanding a considerable allowance than what is already being paid to us. In addition to the fuel and DAT allowance, paramedic services staff are entitled to overtime and public holiday allowances. But doctors are being paid an overtime allowance that is four times more than what is being paid for employees in this sector,” Rohana further said.",
        "In a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Joint Council on Paramedic Health Professionals President Ravi Kumudesh expressed his disappointment over granting an allowance only for doctors. The letter reiterated that they would take stern trade union action if their demands are not fulfilled. However staffers at children’s, maternity, kidney and cancer hospitals and the central blood bank would continue their services on a voluntary basis to minimise inconveniences faced by patients. He further said that the strike action would continue in different stages and that they would intensify their actions if the government fails to respond within the week.",
        "However the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) questioned trade unions on the demands that they made prior to launching the strike action. “These employees also requested for a Rs. 20,000 allowance for state sector employees and already the government had approved a Rs. 10,000 allowance,” said GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge. “There are various categories in the administrative service and the allowances for doctors differ from those allocated for employees in other categories. Therefore it is rather funny to see employees in the paramedic services demanding the same benefits as those allocated for doctors. So far the government has approved 50% of their demand by granting a Rs. 10,000 allowance for state sector employees but the government has failed to approve at least 10% of demands made by doctors,” said Dr. Aluthge.",
        "Speaking about the allowance granted for doctors Dr. Aluthge further said that the government has taken a step in the right direction in ensuring economic justice for doctors. “We repeatedly made the government aware of the assets that they are losing in the wake of multiple crises that affected the country over the past 2-3 years. One of the biggest challenges we faced was in retaining doctors in the country. Therefore we provided various recommendations from time to time and several of these including promotions for doctors in different grades were implemented in the 2024 Budget as well,” he added.",
        "Dr. Aluthge further said that senior employees in the state sector are entitled to a specific transport allowance estimated at Rs. 150,000. “From this they cover their fuel costs, driver fees etc., but doctors weren’t entitled to a transport allowance. Instead what they were entitled to was the DAT allowance. As per the last update in 2015, doctors were promised a Rs. 40,000 allowance but they only received Rs. 35,000. In 2018 the estimated DAT allowance for doctors was Rs. 150,000. However with the recent increase in fuel prices the DAT allowance entitled for doctors is estimated at Rs. 300,000.Therefore the decision to increase this allowance has provided some hope for doctors to continue their services in the country,” he said."

        "The JVP-led NPP government has failed to carry out its promise to import rice due to some flaws in the process of preparing tenders. It has asked for some more time to bring in the promised rice from India. Private traders have already imported 72,000 MT of rice. The state sector stands exposed for its inefficiency.",
        "Is it that the new government is not competent enough to carry out even a simple task like importing rice, which successive governments resorted to, as an ad hoc measure, to address the issue of escalating prices of rice, instead of taming the Millers’ Mafia? Why the incumbent administration has botched the process of tendering for rice imports defies comprehension. Has anyone scuttled the government’s import plan in support of the private sector importers, as alleged by the Opposition, and some consumer rights protection groups, which have called for a probe?",
        "It has been pointed out in Parliament that the government is taxing imported rice at the rate of Rs. 65 a kilo and boosting its revenue instead of making a serious effort to make rice available at affordable prices vis-à-vis market manipulations by the Millers’ Mafia. The Opposition has alleged that some powerful millers are also among the rice importers, and they are getting the best of both worlds.",
        "Close on the heels of the JVP-led NPP’s victory in the last presidential election, the owner of Araliya Rice, Dudley Sirisena, who is one of the wealthy millers blamed for manipulating rice/paddy markets and exploiting farmers and consumers alike, promised at a media briefing to ensure that there would be enough rice in the market at the then maximum retail prices stipulated by the Consumer Affairs Authority. The medium/small scale millers panicked and released all their rice stocks to the market, but the millers’ cartel did not do so and is now making the most of the artificially created rice scarcity to earn unconscionable profits.",
        "The government, in its wisdom, increased the maximum retail prices of rice by Rs. 10 and played into the hands of the rice hoarders. As a result, the price of nadu rice has increased from Rs. 230 much to the glee of the powerful millers! The price of this particular variety of rice, which is popular among a majority of Sri Lankans, was about Rs. 180 before the 21 September presidential election.",
        "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and other JVP/NPP stalwarts have gone on record as saying that the country has produced enough paddy, and the rice shortage is due to hoarding, but the government has baulked at taking on the hoarders and is trying band-aid remedies.",
        "The government has extended the deadline for rice imports until 10 Jan. 2025. The large-scale millers will ensure that more rice is imported before the commencement of the next harvesting period so that they can release some of their stocks, flood the rice market, bring down the prices of rice and exploit farmers by purchasing paddy at cheaper rates. Thereafter, they will hoard their paddy, causing the prices of rice to rise. They also leverage their influence derived from their financial prowess to delay bank loans for small/medium-scale millers so that the latter cannot begin purchasing paddy when harvesting commences.",
        "Previous governments did not care to put an end to the powerful millers’ sordid operations, and the people expected the incumbent administration to be different due to its rhetoric and numerous promises. That is why they voted overwhelmingly for it in last month’s general election, enabling it to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament. But the millers’ cartel with political connections and huge slush funds, continues to call the shots. Have the people been taken for a ride again?",

        "Is it reasonable for the Government to take on more debt to build tracks and commit taxpayer funds to a service that is incapable of even covering operational costs?",
        "An outspoken activist justified his support for Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) because of the superiority of the manifesto proposals on public transport, especially railways. It’s possible that the actual decision was taken on some other basis, but the railway proposals shed light on a larger problem. I had studied the manifestos in detail but paid little attention to sector proposals, considering them irrelevant in the context of the financial constraints any successful candidate would have to work within in 2024-29.",
        "I rechecked the manifestos. Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) discussed transport infrastructure relevant to the export economy briefly but made no mention of railways. Sajith Premadasa (SP) made six promises on transport, of which one was on rail (reviving the Kelani Valley light rail transport project cancelled by Gotabaya Rajapaksa). AKD’s manifesto contained eight detailed promises on railways alone, all suitable for inclusion in a wish list:",
        "Repairing railway tracks which are in a dilapidated (sic) state, introducing a formal maintenance program, and establishing an automatic signal system with new technology",
        "Based on practical requirements developing main railway lines into two-tracks, and lines around main cities as three-track lines",
        "Gradually expanding railway lines on a priority basis to cover the regions which are not covered by the railway network at present, and thereby giving railway access to all main cities",
        "An efficient 24/7 railway service by including more train compartments and increasing running frequency",
        "Gradually developing the railway system to have trains run on electricity",
        "Efficiently using the railway service to safely transport production raw material, consumer goods, and agricultural and fisheries produce",
        "Development of parking facilities near train stations to park private vehicles owned by passengers",
        "Gradually introducing monorail and light railway transport to strengthen public transport in populated areas, whilst prioritising the programs to develop railway and bus services",
        "It is understandable that the AKD manifesto would appear attractive, especially for those who care about public transport, a sorely neglected part of the economy. But, the activist should have at least gone beyond the wish list to see whether the promises had been costed and whether the sources of funding were realistic. With a few exceptions, none of the manifesto promises had been costed by any candidate. No estimates had been provided for the massively expensive railway and expressway promises. Given the tax cuts and Government salary increases proposed by all candidates to varying degrees, there is little or no money for the required capital expenditures. And there are limits on how much debt can be taken on.",
        "But even if there was money, is it wise to put more resources into this sector?",
        "The railway is a strange business in Sri Lanka. Revenues crashed in 2020 and 2021 because of COVID and lockdowns and then increased well above the pre-lockdown levels in 2022. Anyone could see the load factors were up. This could be attributed to a shift to rail travel because of shortages and higher prices affecting the alternative modes. One would expect the losses to decrease when more revenue was generated. But instead, recurrent expenditure doubled, resulting in the largest losses since 2017. And all this without taking into consideration capital expenditures.",
        "Even in a system like Sri Lanka’s where investments in track and rolling stock are minimal (exceptions being the Main Line to KKS and the Beliatta extension, Table 1 shows that capital expenditures, exceed recurrent expenditures in most years. If proper modernisation is undertaken, the capital expenditures should be even greater. Modernisation does not mean high-speed trains like in China. It just means not going at 15 KM/H on the Uva line, not having to use ear plugs after Polgahawela, etc. It means the quality of transport offered by the IRCON constructed new tracks on the Main Line to KKS.",
        "Where should the money come from? Is it reasonable for the Government to take on more debt to build tracks and commit taxpayer funds to a service that is incapable of even covering operational costs? What is more reasonable is to expect at least a partial contribution to capital expenditures and/or loan repayments from operations.",
        "The present economic realities do not justify any further investments in railways, unless satisfactory answers can be provided for the above questions. The only way that operational losses can be stanched is by reforms in the way the railway system is operated. That would mean ending the present integrated monopoly structure and changing the organisational culture that permits one or more of the many trade unions to harass and extort the government and the passengers through wildcat strikes like the unannounced strike that stranded passengers in July.",
        "Taking on more debt without reforms is foolish. The more track is laid, greater are the losses as was the case when the Main Line was rebuilt after the war and the Southern Line was extended to Beliatta. The more passengers are carried, greater are the losses as was the case after 2022. The taxpayers bear the burdens of debt repayment. The managers and employees of the railway are completely insulated from that process and enrich themselves at the cost of the taxpayers.",
        "Realigning the incentives of the managers and employees does not mean that all subsidies have to be stripped out. The substitute for rail transport is road transport where the taxpayers bear most of the costs of the roadway through taxes on fuel and general taxes. The profitability of a road transport company is not calculated by factoring in all the costs of the roadway and does not include the negative externalities of pollution and congestion. It would be reasonable for taxpayers to contribute to rail track investments in the form of viability gap financing.",
        "This leads to a reform design that would separate the building and maintenance of track from train operations. The state role would be greater in track given the significant public contribution in terms of land, rights of way, etc. Ideally, some form of competition would be introduced in train operations along with private investment. The State would, of course, play a strong role in regulation and in ensuring competition is effective.",
        "None of the critical issues identified above are addressed in the NPP wish list or in the other manifestos. There is no money to fulfil any of the wishes. Even if there was money, it would be foolish to put it into the railway sector under the present circumstances.",
        "Macro-economic stability is the highest priority at this time. But action to remove the constraints to growth must be started in parallel. Infrastructure reform takes time and must address multiple interacting components. Merely calling for bids to develop valuable railway land in urban centres will not suffice.",
        "Support for reform, and even privatisation, has gone up significantly. What was said or not said in the manifestos is irrelevant. Work to develop a sector reform plan using international experience must start now."

        "A few months ago, in the heart of Sri Lanka’s commercial capital, where the pulse of urban life beats strongest, there stood a dormant skeleton of promise – a halted condominium project, whispering tales of dashed dreams and broken ambitions. Amidst the rubble and despair, Westbury Suites spearheaded and fuelled by the vision and determination of Project Director Muhez Muzammil emerged to bring life back to the said venture, despite the doubts/concerns raised by experts and industry professionals.",
        "The project which was under the supervision and leadership of the team lead by Muhez, was not willing to let its potential languish in obscurity. Armed with strategic foresight and unwavering resolve, they embarked on a journey of revitalisation, turning the tide of misfortune into a beacon of hope.",
        "Initially via meticulous planning and assessment, Muhez and his colleagues delved deep into the project’s history, which enabled them to unravel key areas for improvement. Through comprehensive market research and feasibility studies, Westbury Suites unearthed opportunities hidden beneath the surface, envisioning a future where the derelict edifice would rise anew, a testament to resilience and innovation.",
        "With a clear blueprint in hand, the Westbury team devised strategies not only to rebuild the structures, but trust and confidence. They forged alliances with stakeholders, fostering open communication and transparency in every step of the way. Drawing on their expertise and ingenuity, Westbury Suites executed creative solutions to financial challenges, leveraging resources and capitalising on emerging trends in real estate.",
        "Further, it wasn’t just about bricks and mortar – it was about community. Recognising the project’s potential to enrich lives and foster connections, Westbury Suites infused it with a sense of purpose and belonging. Collaborating with industry professionals and entrepreneurs, they curated vibrant spaces where residents could thrive, from rooftop gardens to communal spaces brimming with life.",
        "As construction cranes soared and scaffolding stretched skyward, anticipation rippled through the cityscape. The once-halted project became a symbol of renewal, sparking curiosity and admiration in equal measure. With each milestone reached, Westbury Suites commitment to excellence shone brighter.",
        "In the annals of real estate, the story of reviving the Campbell Avenue project by Westbury Suites, stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring power of vision. Through adversity and uncertainty, this tale reminds us that with courage and determination, even the darkest of shadows can be dispelled, giving way to a brighter tomorrow."

        "Pulitzer Prize-Winning Poet Prof. Gregory Pardlo to Chair Jury for 32nd Gratiaen Prize",
        "The Gratiaen Trust, in association with John Keells Foundation, is delighted to announce its collaboration with New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) for the 32nd Gratiaen Prize. This collaboration will see Prof Gregory Pardlo – a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and the Head of the Literature and Creative Writing Program of NYU Abu Dhabi in the Arts and Humanities academic division – heading the Gratiaen Prize jury in addition to participating in a number of other activities that will contribute to the enrichment of the literary arts in Sri Lanka.",
        "The Trust’s collaboration with NYUAD marks another milestone in its three-decade-long commitment to fostering literary arts in the country. Given NYUAD’s strong focus on the liberal arts and its highly regarded Literature and Creative Writing Programme, this collaboration marks another significant step where the Trust has facilitated connections between Sri Lankan creative writers and international Anglophone writing and publishing – a central part of the mission of the Gratiaen Trust that its founder Michael Ondaatje envisaged. Prof. Pardlo, speaking of the collaboration said that he is “looking forward to participating in and contributing to Sri Lanka’s dynamic and exciting literary scene. This partnership deepens NYUAD’s commitment to the region and its varied and rich forms of cultural expression.”",
        "In a joint statement Co-chairs of the Gratiaen Trust, Nisreen Jafferjee and Nafeesa Amiruddeen said, “This partnership not only adds international prestige to The Gratiaen Trust but also opens new avenues for Sri Lankan authors to engage with a global audience, particularly as this year’s event includes both the 32nd Gratiaen Prize and the HAIG Prize for Translations. The Trust’s collaboration with NYUAD will enable a greater exchange of ideas, resources, and opportunities for Sri Lankan writers and translators to further develop their craft and reach new markets. NYUAD’s collaboration, coming at a time when Sri Lankan writers (or those associated with Sri Lanka) have won prestigious international recognition such as the Booker Prize, The Women’s Prize for Fiction and the Nebula Award provides inspiration for Sri Lankan writers to dream big and see themselves as part of the global literary scene.”",
        "Over the years, the Gratiaen Prize has established itself as the most coveted recognition for English-language creative writing in Sri Lanka. Each year, a panel of three distinguished judges—a writer, an academic, and an informed reader—brings a balanced and holistic perspective to the judging process. These carefully curated judging panels and their expertise ensure that the best literary talent on offer each year is recognised and celebrated.",

        "The parties in contest are highly unlikely to get the required majority of votes due to the ‘societal polarisation’ that we witness today",
        "Everybody is enthusiastic about the forthcoming elections in Sri Lanka, almost forgetting the priorities of the ongoing economic crisis, sustainability of businesses and livelihood of people. However, generally, people think that electing a new government may resolve all problems in order to achieve their aspirations. This article attempts to evaluate the risks in the contexts of ‘holding elections’, ‘continuing the present government at least for a brief period – allowing the economy to stabilise’ and the implications in the perspective of risk management.",
        "The parties in contest are highly unlikely to get the required majority of votes due to the ‘societal polarisation’ that we witness today. Societal polarisation is the third-most severe risk in the short term, among the top 10 risks outlined by the WEF (World Economic Forum) Global Risk Report 2024. All major parties may eventually be ended up with less than 50%, due to the polarisation in thinking and the misinformation and disinformation heighten the confusion in the mindset of the voters.",
        "Classification of Risk: Likelihood – High | Magnitude – High",
        "In addition to the polarisation, the ‘experience of voters’ as opposed to the promises made in elections during the past 10 years has fortified a huge ‘negative cognitive dissonance’ in the mindset. Both factors can hinder the expectation for a ‘majority’.",
        "This situation might place the country at a risk of delays in deciding on an elected leader/government for a brief period, which may have unexpected conflicts for power and even lead to a ‘political unrest’, similar to 2022, causing a ‘reputational risk’. The interest groups may capitalise this ‘opportunity of instability’ to achieve their goals at any cost. The ‘human and financial capital’ and ‘businesses’ may again ‘start’ deserting the country due to uncertainty.",
        "Scenario 1 may lead to a situation where the leaders may be compelled to consider the option of a coalition government, in order to secure the short-term stability. This may hinder the economic recovery of the country and conflicts on contrasting political interests would directly jeopardise the stability of the legislature and the executive.",
        "Classification of Risk: Likelihood – High | Magnitude – High",
        "Risk treatment: Terminate (the activity generating the risk) and/or Treat (the risk in order to reduce the magnitude/likelihood of impact). Here, one has to consciously apply both options to the respective elements of the risk to mitigate the impact.",
        "This is constructed on a ‘possible’ outcome of the ‘current trend’ of the polarisation towards a party, which has not yet governed as the ruling party of the country. Case example: If this party, gets a majority of 50.25% (High possibility and remote probability), which is sufficient for a legitimate ruling, then there is a greater probability of misusing/abusing that power by a fractional group, who follows the similar political philosophy, which also has a reputation for violence and coercion. Fractions may employ the kind of ‘violent tactics’, to ‘seize that power’ (Case example: social unrest in 2022), to establish controls in their ‘localities’, which may cause disturbance to peace. These fractions may leverage the ‘animosity’ created amongst the ‘Haves’ and “Haves-not’ via the ‘misinformation and disinformation’ in social media by various political propaganda (e.g. ‘transferring judicial powers to people in respective localities’ – an intention declared in public by a politburo member).",
        "The elected party may take time to bring such a situation under control, considering their current level of control on these group/s. This may lead to an ‘instability’ in governing as the elected party may be compelled to defend their ‘hard-gain of ruling power’ as an immediate priority from any foreseeable threats. Further, this situation becomes an opportunity to the fractions who have been clamouring for ‘decentralisation of strategic power’, showcasing the inability of the controlling affairs of the country by the elected Government.",
        "Classification of Risk: Likelihood – low to medium (depends upon the trends) | Magnitude – High",
        "Risk treatment: Terminate (the activity generating the risk) and/or Treat (the risk in order to reduce the magnitude/likelihood of impact).",
        "The adaptability of the ‘risk treatment’ is important than rigid controls. However, vigilant monitoring can assist in assessing the likelihood and magnitude of identified/emerging risks, which may evolve with the ‘trends in the pre-election period’. However, the authorities should place appropriate measures to mitigate any impact to the country, in this special context, by provisioning for such eventualities.",
        "We must also remember that no democracy has survived without political stability. Moreover, the economic stability stems from the policy stability, depending on the ‘political stability’.",

        "Soon after the election of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, his interim government said it would not privatize state-owned national carrier SriLankan Airlines. Later, it said a decision would be taken after the November 14 parliamentary election.",
        "It is not clear what will be done with SriLankan which also has a defaulted bond and other loans. The last administration was also planning the privatize several state ventures which were hit by procedural delays.",

        "“They were planning to sell by divesting from the government. Our government policy is different",
        "“We have handed over these institutions to ministries to assess them and see how best we can use them to the country’s development,” he said.",
        "“We don’t consider institution wise, we see where Sri Lanka Telecom stands in the country’s economy in the future, where SriLankan Airlines stands in the country’s tourism and economy. We consider all the institutions in that way. So, we are trying to manage these institutions with that vision.”",
        "The SOE restructuring is considered as important as debt restructuring, because most of the state institutions run by the government had been mismanaged and running at a loss with the tax payers had to bear the losses.",
        "The previous government led by Ranil Wickremsinghe called bids for state-owned Hotel Developers Lanka Ltd, Canwill Holdings Pvt Ltd, Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, Litro Gas Lanka Limited, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Ltd, and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Ltd.",
        "Cabinet spokesman said privatization will only be the second step, if the current move with regard to SOE fails.",
        "“Let’s see how we can make these institutions productive without corruption in the government and institutions. Our first effort is to keep these institutions under the government and make them contribute to the country’s development. If that effort fails only we will have to consider the second step.”",
        "The impact of state enterprises on public finances as well as state banks has been an issue that the IMF program has tried to address as particularly the debt of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Sri Lankan figured in the default restructuring.",
        "“We are discussing with the IMF. Some of the concessions are being given while discussing with the IMF and within the existing (IMF) framework. IMF also has not put forward rigid conditions that can’t be changed,” Jayatissa said when asked if there is a pressure from the IMF for restructuring.",
        "“If they (IMF) have the confidence on the country’s spending and revenue, we can change certain things. In fact we are considering how important these conditions and these institutions are for our country and benefits for people.”",
        "“The IMF is on one side and the government is on the other side. We are discussing with the IMF aiming on the country’s goal with the people’s aspirations. They have been continuing the disbursement while we are explaining them the issues from the public point of view. We are carrying forward the discussion in a way it will give least pressure to the public.” (Colombo/January 1/2025 – Update II)"

        "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will look at pardons for those involved in the 2021 US Capitol riot on his first day back in office next month.",
        "“These people are living in hell,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press in his first broadcast network interview since winning November’s election.",
        "The Republican also vowed to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in the country, but offered to work with Democrats to help some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children.",
        "In the wide-ranging sit-down, which was recorded on Friday, Trump promised to issue “a lot” of executive orders, including on immigration, energy and the economy, after he is inaugurated on 20 January.",
        "While he suggested he would not seek a justice department investigation into Joe Biden, he said that some of his political adversaries, including lawmakers who investigated the Capitol riot, should be jailed.",
        "Trump was asked whether he would seek to pardon the hundreds of people convicted of involvement in that riot, when supporters of his stormed Congress three months after his defeat in the 2020 election.",
        "“We’re going to look at independent cases,” he said. “Yeah, but I’m going to be acting very quickly.”",
        "Trump continued: “You know, by the way, they’ve been in there for years, and they’re in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn’t even be allowed to be open.”",
        "The president-elect made other news in the NBC interview aired on Sunday:",
        "He offered a caveat on whether he would keep the US in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato): “If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re doing a fair - they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely, I’d stay with Nato.”",
        "Trump said he would not seek to impose restrictions on abortion pills, though when asked to make a guarantee, he added: “Well, I commit. I mean...things change.”",
        "The Republican said Ukraine should “probably” expect less aid when he returns to the White House.",
        "Trump said he thinks “somebody has to find out” if there is a link between autism and childhood vaccines - an idea that has been ruled out by multiple studies around the world. Trump suggested his nominee for health secretary, vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, would look into the matter.",
        "The president-elect repeated his promise that he will not seek to cut Social Security, nor raise its eligibility age, though he said he would make it “more efficient”, without offering further details.",
        "Pressed on whether his plan to impose tariffs on imports from major US trading partners would raise consumer prices for Americans, he said: “I can’t guarantee anything. I can’t guarantee tomorrow.”",
        "On the subject of immigration, Trump told NBC he would seek through executive action to end so-called birthright citizenship, which entitles anyone born in the US to an American passport, even if their parents were born elsewhere.",
        "Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that “all persons born” in the United States “are citizens of the United States”.",
        "“We’re going to have to get it changed,” Trump said. “We’ll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it.”",
        "Trump also said he would follow through on his campaign pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, including those with family members who are US citizens.",
        "“I don’t want to be breaking up families,” he said, “so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.”",
        "Trump also said he wants to work with Congress to help so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were shielded under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Trump once attempted to scrap.",
        "“I will work with the Democrats on a plan,” he said, adding that some of these immigrants have found good jobs and started businesses.",
        "Trump seemed to offer mixed signals on whether he would follow through on his repeated vows to seek retribution against political adversaries.",
        "Outgoing US President Joe Biden this week issued a sweeping pardon to his criminally convicted son, Hunter. The Democrat is reported to be considering other blanket pardons for political allies before he leaves office next month.",
        "Trump seemed to indicate that he would not seek a special counsel investigation into Biden and his family, as he once vowed.",
        "“I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said. “I’m looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success.”",
        "But he also said that members of the now-defunct, Democratic-led House of Representatives committee that investigated him “should go to jail”.",
        "One member of the panel, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, hit back at Trump on Sunday.",
        "She said his comment that members of the committee should be jailed was a “continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic”.",
        "In his NBC interview Trump also said he would not direct the FBI to pursue investigations against his foes.",
        "But he also told the network: “If they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably.",
        "“They went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.”"

        "Cultivation using the Sorjan method has been very successful, especially in the Western Province. Steps should be taken to introduce this method or more advanced methods of cultivation, if available.

        "The resolution marks a further toughening of Washington’s stance toward Israel. Earlier in the five-month-long war, the U.S. was averse to the word ceasefire and vetoed measures that included calls for an immediate ceasefire.",

        "The main sticking point has been that Hamas says it will release hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, while Israel says it will discuss only a temporary pause.",
        "The U.S. has wanted any Security Council support for a ceasefire to be linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",
        "Israel’s offensive has killed almost 32,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.",
        "The resolution is also intended to deliver a surge in humanitarian aid to Gaza, where severe hunger is worsening.",
        "During the war, Washington has vetoed three draft resolutions, two which would have demanded an immediate ceasefire. Most recently, the U.S. justified its veto by saying such council action could jeopardize ceasefire talks.",
        "The U.S. traditionally shields Israel at the U.N. But it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions on increasing aid and calling for extended pauses in fighting."

        "It was attended by diplomats, representatives of international organisations, senior officials of relevant Ministries and agencies, military personnel, leading researchers and university students.",
        "Delivering the keynote address at the event, the Foreign Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary for East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa Yasoja Gunasekera underscored the urgent need for global action to regulate Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Weapons Systems. She emphasised that while AI has become integral to numerous sectors, its growing presence on the battlefield raises profound concerns regarding its application in weapon systems. The Additional Secretary recalled that it was under the Chairmanship of Sri Lanka in 2015, that the high contracting parties to the convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) agreed to elevate the discussion of LAWS from an informal expert led discussion to a State-led dialogue, leading to the establishment of the first meeting of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) at the 2016 CCW Review Conference. She noted that in addition to actively engaging in the GGE, in October 2021 Sri Lanka together with a wide cross regional group of 70 states co-sponsored the first Joint Statement on LAWS at the UNGA and supported the adoption of “the Pact for the Future” by the UNGA in September 2024. Sri Lanka strongly supports the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate LAWS and supports the UN Secretary General and the President of the ICRC’s joint appeal to establish new rules on AWS by 2026.",
        "Earlier welcoming the gathering, LKI Executive Director Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha said the event was intended to salute the role played by the ICRC which commemorated the 75th anniversary of the operation of the Geneva Conventions, without which the world might have been a different place. He recalled the ICRC’s contributions to Sri Lanka since establishing a presence in 1989, particularly during the armed conflict – escorting food and civilian convoys to the North and the East, facilitating immunisation drives, passing messages between the parties in conflict and enabling the return of the wounded and the dead on both sides, and post conflict assistance in mine clearance, disaster response, and in the search for missing persons. Across time, the ICRC had also played an important role in training the security forces on IHL compliance and engaged in prison visitations and supported the improvement of prison conditions. He observed that the theme of the discussion chosen on disarmament, besides being one where the ICRC and Sri Lanka closely collaborated globally, is the focus of several ongoing research endeavours of the LKI in recent times, along with ICT and its contemporary challenges.",
        "Delivering the opening remarks, ICRC Sri Lanka Head of Delegation Severine Chappaz focused on the continued relevance of IHL. Stressing that the main responsibility to apply IHL in good faith lies with States to mitigate human suffering, she underlined the importance of making IHL a national and international political priority. She also emphasised on aspects of IHL that are particularly relevant to Sri Lanka, including the post-conflict application of IHL, which applies specifically to the issue of missing persons, their right to be searched for, the right of their families to know the fate and whereabouts of their missing loved ones and the obligation to prevent people from going missing. She also referred to the significance of national integration of IHL where the National IHL committee of Sri Lanka plays a key role, training the armed forces in IHL, and the dissemination of IHL through academic and religious circles. In her remarks, Sri Lanka’s international engagement in the promotion and development of IHL, notably in the field of disarmament regulations, was also recognised.",
        "ICRC Regional Legal Advisor Prof. Andrei Kozik highlighted the novel humanitarian and legal challenges posed by technological developments including AI and AWS. Delving into the subject, he drew attention to the unique characteristics of AWS that heighten risks for civilians and raise challenges for IHL compliance. In his presentation, Prof. Kozik also clarified the ICRC’s position on AWS, stating that the ICRC calls for new rules that prohibit the use of “unpredictable” and “anti-personnel” autonomous weapons systems. It was noted that in this context, “unpredictability” refers to the discriminatory nature of AWS weapons while “anti-personnel” refers to autonomous weapons designed or used to target humans directly. The ICRC’s report titled “International Humanitarian Law and the challenges of contemporary armed conflicts” was referenced as a source to obtain an overview of some of the challenges for IHL posed by contemporary armed conflicts. The report broadly underscores the humanitarian consequences that could result from the potential loss of human control over the use of force in armed conflict.",
        "Sri Lankan Coordinator for the Global Campaign “Stop Killer Robots” Yanithra Kumaraguru underscored the critical role of ethics in shaping both the legal frameworks and the development of autonomous weapons, especially in areas where current laws may not provide clear guidance. She highlighted several key ethical concerns, including the challenge of ensuring that autonomous weapons comply with international humanitarian law principles and also questioned whether machines could reliably make life-and-death decisions without human biases, stressing the risks of errors that could lead to violations of human dignity. She further discussed the “moral accountability gap”, an ethical concern that extends beyond legal frameworks and asked whether responsibility for actions taken by autonomous weapons lies with designers, operators, or no one at all emphasising the dehumanising consequences of delegating such critical decisions to machines. Stressing the fact that some advocates for autonomous weapons argue that these technologies could lead to greater precision and fewer civilian casualties, Kumaraguru countered that those technological limitations, the unpredictable nature of conflict and the human realities of conflict make such claims overly idealistic.",
        "Defence Ministry Director of Media and Spokesman, and Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) Head Colonel Nalin Herath while acknowledging the ethical challenges posed highlighted the transformative impact of AI on modern warfare emphasising its potential for operational efficiency, noted how such weapons are reshaping combat strategies and in distinguishing civilians from military targets. He raised concern about the growing access of non-state actors to advanced technologies, which heightens unpredictability in conflicts and cautioned against the dangers posed by AI in terms of misinformation and disinformation. Stressing the absence of a global consensus on regulating AI in warfare, he called for caution and cooperation to ensure ethical use of AI and to prevent its misuse.",
        "National Innovation Agency (NIA) Chief Innovation Officer and Pugwash Sri Lanka Past President Prof. Ajith De Alwis addressed the dual-use nature of science, technology, and innovation, particularly in the context of autonomous weapons systems and AI. He noted that since the wright brothers’ revolutionary invention of flight in 1903 which within a decade was quickly adapted for bombing, historically technology had been weaponised. He pointed to the futility of questioning whether blame can be apportioned to autonomous weapons used in wars, what is more crucial is that states create the conditions to prevent wars from taking place in the first place. He emphasised the need for better prioritising of the use of AWS, rather than banning per se, and advocated for leveraging AI and autonomous systems for humanity’s benefit rather than their weaponisation. Pointing to the climate issue where time was running out and the emission trajectories being put into wrong trajectories by all the conflicts going on, he asked that researchers must be persuaded to become more socially responsible, as the scientists who walked out of the “Manhattan Project” which pursued the creation of the atomic bomb. He also advocated strengthening a UN led global mechanism supporting whistle blowing and asked that we push ourselves to value humanity more - touching on the Pugwash principles.",
        "Ambassador Aryasinha who moderated the panel discussion, reflecting on the challenges faced as Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative in Geneva in presiding over the CCW during Sri Lanka’ Presidency of the CCW in 2015/2016 which secured a consensus to commence the discussion of LAWS at the level of States parties nearly a decade ago, regretted that movement had been slow and that many relevant States needed for effective regulation of AWS, opposed or remained ambivalent in supporting such regulation. While the ethical and legal arguments were not in doubt, greater moral persuasion and compromise would be needed to also carry those who already possess or are on the verge of possessing AWS from using them, as war fronts expand and armies seek to minimise casualties.",
        "During an almost hour-long discussion that followed, the audience pointed to the absence of a universal definition, highlighted gaps in International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the politicisation of AWS, the advances and limitations in distinguishing combatants from non-combatants, opaque decision-making, the ethical and legal issues concerned and the slow pace of regulation. They also impressed on the need for a Sri Lanka national policy on AI and AWS, suggested that smaller nations like Sri Lanka press for reforms to protect weaker states. Members of the panel explored the tension between technological innovation and ethical responsibility, emphasising alignment with IHL principles like distinction and proportionality. They underscored transparency in AI’s “black box” decision-making, gaps in IHL related to espionage and information warfare, and the relevance of Article 36 of the Geneva Conventions in reviewing new weapons. The session concluded by stressing collaboration, culturally informed ethical considerations, and practical, legally binding measures to balance technological advances with human oversight."

        "ECONOMYNEXT — The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot speak for the 20 countries and multilateral agencies that Sri Lanka has entered into agreements with, so there is no point approaching the IMF for renegotiation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
        "“We have now come to some stability. We have entered agreements with 18 countries, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The first approval was given to the IMF. It didn’t end there. We then had to talk to China and other countries. We have to work according to this,” Wickremesinghe said speaking at an event in Colombo on Sunday August 25.",
        "Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka has to raise 5 trillion rupees in revenue in 2025.",
        "“If you promise to reduce taxes and give this or that free in your election campaigns, this agreement is broken,” he said.",

        "While the next government can change the source of funding for the five-trillion-rupee revenue target, said Wickremesinghe, it cannot deviate from that target.",
        "“You have to stay on target. If you don’t meet this target, what will happen?”",
        "“They say they’ll talk to the IMF. There’s no point talking to the IMF. It doesn’t have the power to speak for the other 20. That power is over now. You have to go and talk to them again. Is it easy to talk to these countries? To Poland and Hungary. They have bigger problems than our debt. They have issues at the European Union. We have to talk to every country that gave us aid and they must all agree. Can this be done? How long will it take? Get ready with your gas cylinder to wait in line from February,” he said.",
        "Wickremesinghe claimed that it would take four to five months for such a renegotiation.",
        "“This fight is not about who is president, it’s about how do we live? No one in the other two camps can match this team. I know who’s on those teams. Some of them were brought up by me. It is not about my future. Are you ready to hand over your future to these people? That’s all you have to think,” he said. (Colombo/Aug26/2024)"

        "What larks! Ranil can’t make up his mind whether he is the UNP or SLPP (the party of government bearing fealty to Mahinda) candidate. Mahinda’s colour is a beastly cherry; “the workers’ dye is purple now, it got mixed up with blue somehow” goes the ditty. Sajith is torn between a deal with the UNP (Ranil), or going it solo, or come what may, stitching together some other combine.",
        "The perkiest comedy in town is the SLFP where they are quarrelling about, (i) whether Mrs B’s endowments were masculine enough and whether her voice sufficiently gruff, (ii) whether Pissu Sira should be declared a certified lunatic, and (iii) whether Wijeyadasa should sit on this side or that side of the aisle or park his rump in the gangway between. The political scene in Lanka these April days is a Spring Festival of fun and frolic; every political dunce and pantaloon is running wild.",
        "All this jostling and jockeying is in anticipation of the menacing day when the Elections Commissioner will call upon all men, good and true, to submit nominations for the Presidential Elections due later this year. The glaring addition needed to the line-up in the previous para is Anura Kumara who is likely to score a plurality, but perhaps not a majority on the first count. If you want me to guess; Anura may collect up to 40% and a Ranil-Sajith combo with SLPP riff-raff appended may garner, say, 25%. However, the dark-horse in the current topsy-turvy is the SLFP as I will explain anon.",
        "Since I am writing the article I have to put down numbers, otherwise you will stop reading. So, what the hell, can I spit out 15% for the still residual SLFP national base-vote? Let’s add: 40+25+15 makes 80%. This leaves 20% for all the other riff-raff; cranks like Patali, mentally deranged Field Marshals and assorted candidates offering themselves in the first round of the Presidential Election. Come on, this a fair way doing the sums at this early looney stage. Play with the numbers if you will but your guesses won’t be much different from mine eventually.",
        "Now comes the interesting part. If no candidate scores over 50% on first count, the second preferences cast for the first two, and ONLY these two candidates, are tallied and added to the relevant person. Note this carefully. All other second preference votes are discarded. Second preference votes cast by supporters of all other candidates and for all other candidates are discarded. This seems both illogical and unreasonable but see “Counting Second Preferences” below for further comment.",
        "Now, only a complete nut of an Anura-voter will cast a second preference for the UNP-SJB-SLPP block, and vice-versa. That is no UNP-SJB-SLPP voter in his/her right senses will give a second preference to Anura either. (SJB is Samagi Balavegaya, Sajith’s party). Hence when these relevant or permitted second preferences are included, the absolute number of votes for Anura and the UNP-SJB-SLPP block will remain almost unaltered. I call this the Prohibited Cross Voting (PCV) assumption. So, Anura will be elected president by a margin of 40 to 25 in the afore enumerated scenario. This is a stylised example but is intended to illustrate the lie-of-the-land. Let me explain it a little more.",
        "First let me repeat because it is vital though you will find it obvious when you think it over. Say the results of the first vote count are candidate-A (say Anura) is placed first, and candidate-B (the principal opposition candidate) is placed second, or of course, vice-versa. Then the “Prohibited Cross Voting” (PCV) thesis ensures that the candidate who wins the first round will inevitably become the president because the total votes and the relative positions of these two candidates will NOT change because of the PCV behavioural assumption.",
        "Please take a moment to mull this over, though it is self-evident once you get the hang of it. Win the first count and you are the president! Your relative position (total number of votes) will hardly change a jot thanks to the PCV behavioural assumption. Say the first candidate polls 5,550,000 and the second polls 5, 500,00 at the first count. Then after the second count (tallying of second preferences) neither will poll hardly one vote more or one vote less if voters strictly adhere to PCV. Win the first count (round) and you are president, home and dry! PCV underpins this essay but it has other significant consequences as you will see as you read on.",
        "Then the crucial point is how valid is the PCV assumption? In general, and in other countries it may not hold, but violation of PCV is hardly thinkable in present day Lanka and at the upcoming presidential election. Imagine an Anura voter casting his second preference for candidate-B (a Sajith-UNP-SLPP etc offering) or a voter who gives first choice to candidate-B giving second choice to Anura. Unthinkable! Voters may spew out second choices anywhere they wish to and to anyone they like, but not to the principal opponent candidate says the PCV behavioural model’s assumption.",
        "This has crucial implications for Lanka’s political dullards with bursting waistlines in white national-dress costumes protruding at the waist and jutting at the posterior. But they will soon wake up as nomination-day approaches and implications for future scams and graft dawn on these dullards. The most important point is that though the SLFP is in shambles right now and the goings-on are a fool’s carnival, it could emerge as a king-maker. To do so, it must join the candidate-B camp and line up behind this candidate formally. Then we may have candidate-B, including the SLFP, polling say just over 40% while Anura polls say just less than 40%. Anura is then edged out of the presidency if PCV strictly holds. (It may not hold, because some SLFP voters in camp-B may not play strictly by PCV and may be tempted to cast their second preference for Anura, in violation of PCV behaviour. This is possible if you recall that the SLFP once upon a time thought of itself as a left force).",
        "I carefully discussed the way second preferences are counted with a lawyer and Oxonian who says he is an expert on the matter. He assured me that second preference votes cast for all candidates except the first and second are discarded. Furthermore, only second preferences among (within) the first two candidates themselves are taken into account he said.",
        "Second preferences cast by supporters of all other candidates, even for the first two, are discarded he says. (This is the reason for my previous 5.55 and 5.50 million vote examples). This is an absurd system and defeats the whole purpose of giving voters a second preference vote. I must check this expert lawyer’s opinion with other informed people.",
        "I will not question DBS’s personal integrity at this point but his prominent recent column “RW’s Caravan Moves on Despite Barking Dogs” is some panegyric! If it had been crafted in consultation with Ranil himself it could not have been more laudatory. DBS argues that Ranil has managed to hold diverse political forces together within the government, that he has retained the support of Ministers and State Ministers that he inherited from Gotabaya, and most important, DBS claims that only Ranil can pull the country out of the deep morass it has sunk into in the last two years and that he is capable of leading Lanka to economic recovery. Phew! The scribes at Dinamina are surely burning the midnight oil rendering this encomium into Sinhala. DBS’s views also reflect the thinking of educated Tamils and to a degree of pro-capitalist business classes, so they are worth reflecting over.",

      "original_body_lines": [
        "The decades-long civil conflict in Sri Lanka caused immense suffering across all communities—Tamils, Sinhalese, Muslims, and Burghers. While the magnitude of suffering varied, no group emerged unscathed. For many, the pain persisted not just for a year or two, but for over three decades. Those who left the country experienced their share of hardships, though their suffering was incomparable to those who remained amidst the devastation. This isn’t a contest to determine who endured the most; the focus must be on ensuring such a tragedy never happens again.",
        "We must remain vigilant to prevent even the smallest missteps that could unravel the fragile peace and harmony we have today. History has shown us how easily tensions can flare and quickly spiral out of control, a risk amplified manifold in the era of social media. While we cannot bring back those lost too soon, we can take meaningful actions—such as releasing those still unjustly imprisoned—and work tirelessly to ensure that discord does not take root again.",
        "The Tamil people have sent a strong and unprecedented message by giving their mandate to a Sinhalese-led party under Anura Kumara Dissanayake. This marks a historic shift, signaling a desire for change and reconciliation. It is imperative that the current government is given the time and support needed to fulfill its promises. This is not the moment for the diaspora to agitate or create unnecessary noise that could provide fuel for extremist elements to disrupt progress. Any misstep or unnecessary interference risks sowing doubts and reviving suspicions among the majority population—a spark that could reignite old tensions.",
        "The majority of Tamils in Sri Lanka are praying for peaceful coexistence. While it is essential to hold the government accountable, it is equally important to approach this with patience and reason. Previous attempts to address these issues through agitation have failed spectacularly. Why not adopt a new strategy this time—one rooted in cooperation and measured progress? Persisting with the same failed approaches is nothing short of madness.",
        "The diaspora, while often well-meaning, must exercise restraint. Those who claim to safeguard Tamil culture, language, heritage and the territorial integrity must ask themselves: If these values are so paramount, why are they not in Sri Lanka, working to protect them firsthand? Instead, they risk disrupting progress from afar, while enjoying the safety and privileges of Western democracies. It is crucial to avoid becoming pawns in their agendas, often cloaked in the guise of benevolence. Let us give this government a genuine chance to succeed and focus on solutions that prioritize peace and reconciliation for those living through these challenges daily."

        "Six people, including a mother, her four young children and a family acquaintance, were found dead inside a townhouse in the south Ottawa suburb of Barrhaven on March 6. The woman’s husband and father of the children remains in hospital.",
        "A 19-year-old man who was living with the family is in custody facing six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.",
        "According to police, they began receiving calls at 10:52 p.m. Wednesday and responded minutes later. In court, prosecutors said the accused was in custody around 11 p.m.",
        "The day after the tragedy, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) called the killings a “mass shooting” when no guns were involved, repeatedly misspelled the victims’ names and misidentified the accused.",
        "On Thursday morning during a live, nationally broadcast interview on CBC, OPS Chief Eric Stubbs mistakenly called the killings a “mass shooting.”",
        "During a news conference that afternoon, Stubbs misidentified the man in custody as “Frank D’Souza.” Later that day Febrio De-Zoysa, a 19-year-old Sri Lankan national who had come to Canada as a student, was officially charged.",
        "After the news conference on Thursday, OPS issued five separate emails to correct the victims’ names they’d provided earlier that day.",
        "Their first attempt contained errors in three of the six names. The second email contained different errors in the same three names.",
        "A third email corrected two names and the age of a victim. After CBC flagged more errors, OPS replied with yet another correction. Then, at 3 p.m., they issued a final version.",
        "In a statement to CBC, OPS admitted the mistakes and said homicides are “very complex files to investigate and quickly evolving.”",
        "In the case of the Barrhaven killings, police said there were “multiple credible sources consulted in the collating of names, and some information we received was wrong,” OPS said.",
        "“We also made mistakes when we communicated key information about the tragic deaths. That is an inherent risk of the fast paced and timely communications we strive to deliver to Ottawa residents.”",
        "The statement said responding officers and investigators diligently collect information in a process involving contacting “multiple sources, including involved persons (victims/suspects), witnesses, family members and of course official government/databases.”",
        "“Erroneous information is sometimes communicated to police and we can also make mistakes when communicating with the community and media,” OPS said. “When that happens, we correct it as soon as possible.”",
        "Christopher Schneider, a professor of criminology at Brandon University in Manitoba, said communications by Ottawa police were “incredibly problematic” in this case.",
        "“Often one’s competence is judged by their communicative performance,” Schneider said. “If the police are not communicating effectively through traditional media, social media, with the community, that leads to the public perception of police incompetence.”",
        "That in turn “could possibly extend to an erosion of confidence and trust in policing,” he said.",
        "Schneider said ineffective communication from police is magnified when it involves immigrant, refugee and racialized communities, including Indigenous ones.",
        "“These community groups, they talk among themselves and they see this when it comes out in media, they see that the police are not effectively communicating in a tragic, outrageous circumstance like this,” he said.",
        "“This leads to a continuing rotation and distrust in police and policing.”",
        "Darryl Davies, a professor of criminology at Carleton University, said Ottawa police and other first responders would have faced “tremendous pressure” as they arrived at the crime scene.",
        "“That probably contributed to the lack of information and consistency of information that subsequently came out,” Davies said, noting their priority would be locating victims and hunting for the suspect.",
        "“They were probably, understandably, totally caught off guard, and the shock and the horror of witnessing something like that would have unbelievable ramifications on the individuals who are there.”",
        "Davies said that trauma “probably more than anything overshadowed any consistency or communication to the public, because it would have just been so horrific.”",
        "He said even officers prepared with the best possible training would face a “horrific challenge” just trying to process the information.",
        "“The Ottawa police did the best they could under the circumstances, given the horrific nature of the events and how they unfolded.”",
        "But Davies also said police need better training in communicating the details of such tragedies to the public.",
        "“Police as a whole need to have people who are specialized in communications. I think they should be trained in how to deal with these situations,” he said."

      "original_title": "The Idea of the Global South",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "It is easy to celebrate the return of Asia, the rise of the Global South, the resurgence of the Non-Aligned nations of the world. It is harder to chart a course for these countries and regions, to strategise the way forward for them.",
        "The Global South, to be sure, has never been stronger before. The present moment is rife with many possibilities. The US and its allies have effectively lost the moral high ground, though some would argue and not incorrectly that it never held that high ground in the first place. South Africa’s intervention in the ongoing genocide in Gaza is an example of the immense potential of Global Southernism: the trial was launched at the behest, not of China or Russia or any of those countries that have a major issue with the US-led Western alliance, but of a state that had no rivalry or issue with that alliance.",
        "As a foreign policy analyst in Sri Lanka, I welcome these developments unreservedly. We need not beat too much around the bush over them. The future is in Asia, and Asia is returning. History is never linear: it curves and detours, it returns to where it began, then veers off course and meanders. Clearly, the Global South is on course for a comeback. However you may view this, it is a positive development, for the world and the poor nations of the world. Sri Lanka has much to benefit from this, and it should.",
        "But the Global South cannot rise on its own. Nor can it rise without addressing the inherent, internal, systemic challenges it confronts on a daily basis.",
        "The first is political. This is an election year, arguably the most crucial election year in recent history. Several of the world’s most populous countries, including the U.S. and Russia, are going to the polls. So is Sri Lanka. Depending on the political systems which are in place in these countries, they will return – if they already have not – the incumbent. Yet there are cases where the incumbent will be defied and overturned. We are seeing that in Pakistan, where the PTI won a resounding victory despite Imran Khan’s incarceration. We are also seeing it in India, where the INC-led INDI Alliance has gained a bigger voice and space.",
        "The second is economic. The UK has joined a long waiting list of countries that have entered a recession. Much of the Global South is reeling from the fallout that followed COVID-19. With disruptions to supply chains and the prospect of a perpetual war in the Middle-East, Asia and Africa are going to have a tough time. The fundamental contradiction here is between the heterodox policies these countries followed during the COVID period – in Sri Lanka, to give two examples, tax cuts and price controls – and the orthodox neoliberal policies being imposed on them as a prerequisite for economic recovery. Those policies have generated, and are generating, populist backlashes from people.",
        "The third is geopolitical. Contrary to what many think, we are NOT seeing an erosion of the West-led rules-based order that has been in operation since at least 1945. What we are seeing now is a period of transition, from the unipolar hegemony of the West to a multipolar order that will find its pivot in Asia. Amidst these developments, different countries are pursuing different interests, leading to multiple alliances and rivalries. The rules-based order itself is not going to go away soon. But the West no longer dominates these narratives; the Global South does. South Africa is one among many examples of that.",
        "The fourth is cultural-civilisational. The rules-based order was, and is, associated with a set of values which have long been considered as Western. This West-centric view of the world, however, is fast losing ground. Though touted as universal, such a view has been criticised as being biased towards white people. It is this that comes out when Hillary Clinton tweets in dismay at Margot Robbie not getting an Oscar nomination for Barbie, but refuses to notice or acknowledge the hundreds of women and girls suffering in Gaza. Or when journalists who ought to know better shed tears over Ukrainian refugees on the grounds that they are white and blue-eyed and, presumably, more civilised than “us.”",
        "The fifth is intellectual. Nationalist groups in countries like Sri Lanka often couple their criticism of the West with criticisms of what they see as Western knowledge and Western hegemony of knowledge. In Sri Lanka this line was articulated by the likes of Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekara. In itself, it is not inaccurate: it is the proverbial West that has, for decades if not centuries, dominated discussions on issues like economic development and human rights and freedoms. As Edward Said observes in Orientalism, such a critique can be levelled even at radical thinkers like Karl Marx. Yet recent developments, including the Rafah offensive, show that the West’s domination no longer holds.",
        "These are developments the Global South will have to contend with – not eventually, but now, the immediate present. Optimistic as many are about its prospects over the next decade, there are still issues that remain to be addressed and resolved.",
        "Perhaps the most urgent of these is the issue of internal unity. The West held it for so long because, despite occasional squabbles – of which France’s spat with the US over AUKUS is the best example – it is fundamentally of the same mind, though as Europe’s and the US’s shifts on Gaza show, even this unity is eroding.",
        "For the Global South, specifically Asia, Africa, and Latin and Central America, to hold the moral and political ground, it is not enough to call out on the West’s hypocrisy. There must be real, tangible unity on the ground, there must be a countering of perceptions that the Global South is pitted against the West because it receives aid and support from the West’s geopolitical rivals, in particular China and Russia.",
        "More than anything, though, there must be a consensus on what the Global South entails, what its values are, and how, despite differing views on issues like the Red Sea, this part of the world can sustain some sort of continuity on broader concerns.",
        "When asked what he thought of Western civilisation, Gandhi is reported to have said, “I think it would be a good idea.” I believe the Global South is an even better idea: perhaps the best, most progressive we can have in the present world system. But it cannot remain just an idea. It should transform into a living, tangible reality. For that, we need to get out of the past. To get out of the past, we need to embrace a new future. The Global South embodies that future. All it needs to do now is to reconcile itself to it.",

        "UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara, who disturbed a hornets’ nest last week by calling for a poll postponement, was widely expected to make an about-turn yesterday by way of damage control. But he, in his wisdom, stood by what he had said and even peddled an absurd argument that flew in the face of common sense. He only provided more ammunition to the opponents of his master, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, ahead of a crucial election.",
        "Bandara insisted that the Constitution provided for a referendum, and therefore his proposal that the presidential and parliamentary polls be put off by two years with the help of people’s approval at a referendum was consistent with the supreme law. He has exemplified the saying that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.",
        "Constitutional provisions are not there to be abused by governments to compass their political ends. Bandara must have witnessed, as a youth, the devastating impact that the 1982 referendum, with which the UNP did away with a general election, had on the country. The J. R. Jayewardene government rigged the referendum and obtained the result it desired. Thereafter, that oppressive regime went so far as to proscribe the JVP, which had legally challenged the outcome of the referendum, and paved the way for another bloodbath in the late 1980s. Is it that the UNP has not learnt from history?",
        "Some UNP seniors have half-heartedly sought to dissociate themselves from Bandara’s proposal. But the fact that the UNP has not taken any action against Bandara lends credence to the Opposition’s claim that he would not have made that call unbeknownst to the party leadership. The UNP leaders will not be able to wash their hands of their General Secretary’s attempt to stifle democracy. Their claim that he has a right to express his views is not convincing at all. Roshan Ranasinghe was sacked from the Cabinet for expressing his candid opinion about corruption in the cricket administration though his views resonated with all right-thinking Sri Lankans. Bandara continues to be the UNP General Secretary though his proposal at issue has received universal condemnation.",
        "The Opposition has claimed that Bandara’s proposal is tantamount to an admission that the UNP is not sure of winning the coming elections, for if it had been confident of victory, it would never have proposed a poll postponement at this juncture. This argument is not without some merit, and it is likely to be used against President Wickremesinghe.",
        "Bandara’s bêtise reminds us of the proverbial monkey that harmed its royal master in his sleep by striking a mosquito sitting on him with his regal sword. President Wickremesinghe has proved that he is capable of tackling his enemies, but it looks as if not even all deities this country is believed to be home to could save him from his friends. Those who were responsible for the UNP’s ignominious defeat in 2020 have crawled out of the woodwork and are making up for lost time. They have reverted to their old ways; they are busy lining their pockets and antagonising the public. These elements not only indulge in corruption but also shield the corrupt openly, as we saw during the battle between Parliament and Sri Lanka Cricket, which is under a cloud. The UNP, which is full of such characters, has become a millstone around its leader’s neck.",
        "Unappreciative as his critics may be of his political leadership for bringing some order out of chaos on the economic front, President Wickremesinghe’s hard work has not gone unrewarded. His executive powers have helped him with the task of resuscitating the UNP to some extent, and conducting his presidential election campaign at the expense of the state, like his predecessors who leveraged the executive presidency to grant various inducements to the public ahead of elections to garner votes. However, the daunting challenge before him is to win the upcoming presidential election with his trusted lieutenants ruining his chances of winning while enjoying a ride on his coattails.",

        "Kishida took office in 2021 but left so his party could have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals. Ishiba plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27.",
        "Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election.",
        "Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term.",
        "Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members.",
        "“As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japan’s future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet,” Kishida said in a statement, citing the need to bolster security amid a deepening global divide, such as Russia’s war in Ukraine, while tackling a declining birthrate and population, as well as economic and political reforms at home.",
        "Ishiba earlier announced his party’s leaders ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the party’s election task force. He is expected to name defense experts Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief.",
        "The majority of his Cabinet ministers, like Ishiba, are expected to be unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s powerful group linked to damaging scandals.",
        "Ishiba’s lack of stable power base could also mean a fragility of his government, and “could quickly collapse” even though Ishiba hopes to build up party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said.",
        "The move is also seen as revenge by Ishiba, who was largely pushed to the side during most of Abe’s reign.",
        "Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States.",
        "Ishiba outlined his views in an article to the Hudson Institute last week.",
        "“The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense. Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,” he wrote.",
        "Ishiba proposes combining of existing security and diplomatic groupings, such as the Quad and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks involving the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines.",
        "He also noted that the Asian version of NATO can also consider sharing of the control of U.S. nuclear weapons in the region as a deterrence against growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia.",
        "Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea.",
        "He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters.",
        "The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida’s popularity.",
        "Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under Abe."

        "Khan’s party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), said both Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had been sentenced to 10 years each by a special court.",
        "It said the party would challenge the decision and called it a “sham case”.",
        "“We don’t accept this illegal decision,” Khan’s lawyer Naeem Panjutha posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.",
        "It is the second conviction for the embattled former cricket star in recent months. He was previously sentenced to three years in a corruption case. While his jail term was suspended as he challenged the corruption conviction, it had already ruled him out of the country’s general elections next week.",
        "Despite being ruled out of the election, Khan’s legal team was hoping to get him released from jail, where he has been since August last year away from the public eye.",
        "The latest conviction means that is unlikely even as the charges are contested in a higher court.",
        "Khan has been fighting dozens of cases since he was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no confidence in 2022.",
        "Khan says the cable was proof of a conspiracy by the Pakistani military and U.S. government to topple his government in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Washington and the Pakistan military deny the accusations.",
        "The former prime minister has previously said the contents of the cable appeared in the media from other sources."

        "The Government needs to submit a plan to encourage installation of solar power by individual homes and the industry, with reduced interest loans from commercial banks",
        "The country has almost exhausted its cheapest power hydro-electricity. Only possibility is major movement towards solar power, especially by small and medium scale industries and house owners. Most convenient new solar users would be factories and offices, who normally work during day-light hours. Also, most schools have fans in the classrooms. They could install solar panels on the roofs, eliminating electricity bills. The parents who installed the fans in classrooms could also install solar panels",
        "The country’s citizens are lucky, with uninterrupted electrical power supply met from large and small hydro power plants, thermal power stations owned by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and private, also to a lesser degree with bio-energy, solar and wind power. The situation could be improved with moving over to more solar and wind power.",
        "Electricity generated from hydro-power, wind, solar and bio-energy are referred to as renewable energy. The country’s hydro power sources are almost exhausted. Wind and solar power have enormous potential, initial investments are slightly higher then thermal, but running costs are low, without imports.",
        "Solar is only during the day with intensity reducing with clouds, wind throughout the day and night, but wavering over the time and months. The country’s highest electricity demand is from 6:30 to 9 p.m. Thus solar could only contribute towards meeting the day time demand with hydro contributing throughout. Today, balance is met with thermally generated power.",
        "Recently pumped water storage is proposed, using excessive solar power during the day time to pump water to higher levels and using the same to generate electricity during the peak hours (more later).",
        "Biomass projects generate power by burning tree branch cuttings or paddy husk under controlled conditions. Branch cuttings of plants (mostly grilicedia) are collected from rural farmers and paddy husk produced during milling of paddy, that are normally disposed by burning. Gliricedia plant roots known for its nitrogen fixing abilities and improve soil fertility, whose leaves are generally used as animal feed, rots easily is an excellent manure. Most dendro-power plants located in the dry rural sector, provide employment and income opportunities to growers and transporters.",
        "Wind and solar power are highly acclaimed throughout the world, with energy produced causing least pollution and free, neither available uniformly nor throughout the day. Solar power is popular in Arab countries with massive investments. Technologies and equipment for solar and wind are imported from developed countries and are expensive, but with low running costs.",
        "Currently, Hambantota wind farm owned by CEB has a production capacity of 3 MW and the Puttalam farm with a capacity of 10 MW. A wind farm consisting of 30 towers generating 100 MW (Phase 1 – Thambapawani) was established on the southern coast of Mannar Island in 2021, with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).",
        "The Buruthakanda Solar Park in Hambantota by Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), first commercial scale solar power station completed in 2012, producing 737 KW in the first stage and 500 KW in the second stage.",
        "The Ambassador of the Republic of Korea, officially handed over Sri Lanka’s first-ever floating solar photovoltaic power plant located at Chandrika Wewa and Kiriibban Wewa reservoirs. The $ 5 million project, with floating solar photovoltaic power plant capable of generating 1MW, uses the reservoir surface, conserving land resources while reducing environmental impact.",
        "A World Bank report of August 2007 identified nearly 5,000 sq. km with good-to-excellent wind resource potential of 24,000 MW. About 4,100 sq. km of land and 700 sq. km in lagoons, largely concentrated in the north western coast from Kalpitiya Peninsula north to Mannar Island, Jaffna Peninsula, also central highlands.",
        "A strong stream of wind passes through the Strait of Mannar. The high speed winds moving from south to north and vice versa between central mountains of Sri Lanka and South Indian mountains through Strait of Mannar, allows generation of electricity power.",
        "Using the same, State of Tamil Nadu has installed six wind power projects, with a capacity of 7,450 MW becoming the leader in India. The largest is the Muppandal Wind Farm with a capacity of 1,500 MW, making it the world’s forth largest onshore wind farm.",
        "CEB installed a 103 MW wind power plant in Mannar Island with ADB assistance, costing $ 135 million and commissioned on 18 May 2021, named “Thambapavani”. The plant with 30 wind turbine generators located along the southern coast of Mannar Island. The produced electricity generated by the wind plant cost less than 4 US Cents a kWHr.",
        "But the proposed project located on the narrow ‘movement corridor’ where millions of migratory birds moving from north to south and back are severely objected by the environmentalists.",
        "CEB’s Long Term Generation Expansion Plans (LTGEP) prepared for 2023-2042 proposes:",
        "Achieve 70% of electricity generation in the country using renewable energy (RE) sources by 2030.",
        "New addition of firm capacity will be from clean energy sources such as regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG).",
        "In addition, the plan allows pumped storage of 300 MW each for years 2029 and 2030, also are 1,400 MW Pumped Hydro Storage development by 2032 and 3,365 MW Battery Energy Storage development by 2042, requiring an average annual investment of $ 1.4 billion for generation and storage capacity additions.",
        "As per CEB generation statistics on 21 November, the combined output from the Laxapana, Mahaweli, and Samanala hydro complexes, along with CEB and Small Power Producer (SPP), wind energy and SPP solar, biomass, and mini-hydro sources, amounted to 27.22 GWh. Considering total energy generated was 47.47 Gwh, renewable energy amounts approximately to 57.35% of total energy generation. Thus achieving 70% target by 2030, Sri Lanka needs to increase its RE contribution by 27% within the next five years.",
        "Up to now, CEB showed reluctance to connect small and medium renewable plants, claiming the connection will destabilise their distribution system. But, recently, ADB agreed to provide a loan of $ 200 million to Sri Lanka to upgrade the power sector infrastructure, enhancing the reliability of transmission and distribution facilities of renewable energy, which will enable CEB to connect the renewable systems.",
        "The Phase II of the Mannar Wind Energy Park of capacity 200 MW, similar to Phase I with a 5 km 132 kV transmission line. The proposed turbines located 2 km away from the existing wind turbines and production costs would be similar.",
        "In 2022, the billionaire Indian businessman Gautham Adani visited Sri Lanka and met the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and visited the proposed wind power project site. Subsequently, the Ministry of Power and Energy, received an unsolicited proposal for the construction and operation of the Mannar Wind Power Project (Phase-II), as Build, Own and Operate project for a 25-year period with an investment of $ 500 million.",
        "But with a lawsuit filed in New York court, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adani family are facing serious allegations of bribing personnel in implementing projects. Thus offering a project to Adani family would no longer feasible.",
        "Sri Lanka being close to the equator, receives an abundant supply of solar radiation year around without a marked seasonal variation. Roof-top solar is possible throughout the country except in higher elevations. Solar-parks are possible in the western coastal belt from Kalpitiya to Jaffna, Northern Province, also Hambantota and Monaragala districts due to flat dry terrain and low rain. In addition, parts of lagoons, lakes and reservoirs could host solar-parks. Thus the country’s solar and wind production capacity is beyond imagination, only needs implementation.",
        "SLSEA introduced rooftop solar power units in 2010 which became a success, and led to Surya Bala Sangramaya or the battle for solar energy in 2016. New program targets adding 1,450 MW by 2025. Currently 20,000 solar systems supply 215 MW to national grid, dominated by small roof-top solar installations. Thus rooftop solar needs to be promoted vehemently.",
        "Under the current system, rooftop solar producers up to 500 KWs are paid a Rs. 37 flat rate for 20 years, while systems above 50 KWs are paid Rs. 34.50 per unit.",
        "Sri Lanka’s first and the largest power station implemented as a joint venture by CEB with aid from EXIM Bank of China. It was constructed by China Machinery Engineering Corporation at a cost of $ 1.35 billion. The contract was signed in 2006 and the first phase of 300 MW was commissioned in 2011, including the construction of 115 km transmission line connecting the plant to the national grid through the Veyangoda substation.",
        "The Norochcholai Coal Power Plant located in Puttalam District, on the West Coast of the Kalpitiya Peninsula. The power plant proposed as 3 phases, each phase adding 300 MW, making the total power generated as 900 MW. A 300 MW unit of the Norochcholai plant would use between 650,000 to 700,000 tonnes of coal a year.",
        "There are large number of small and medium scale industries, who are occupied during daytime (when the sun is shining) with large roofs. Also are large number of supermarkets, all with large roofs. These roofs could be utilised effectively by installing solar power systems. Solar panels on the roof will reduce the sun-light on the roof, reducing the air-conditioning load below. Some Supermarkets already have solar panels on their roofs, others too could follow and owners cannot claim to be short of funds.",
        "I have installed a 14 kW solar system on my roof-top, costing Rs. 2.1 million, the system consisting of 34 solar panels. I have paid all requirements to CEB and am awaiting them to connect the solar power system.",
        "Now that Adani’s wind power proposal is no longer acceptable, the Governments need to call for expression of interest world-wide for future installation wind power systems in Mannar, Jaffna regions as well as up on the hills. In the hilly areas, most grounds are Government owned and there would be no objection for the locals.",
        "A pumped storage hydro-electric plant generally consists of two water reservoirs at different levels, connected with each other. During low electricity demand, excess generation capacity (excessive solar power) is used to pump water into the upper reservoir. With the high demand in peak hours, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine (usually a Francis turbine), generating electricity.",
        "Pumped storage plants, usually use reversible turbine/generator assemblies, acting both pump and as a turbine generator at variable speed operation, further optimising the efficiency in pumped hydro storage tanks. For pumping of water, also for power generation, the same pump is used by changing rotational direction and speed.",
        "Pumped storage power plants (PSPPs) have been identified as a viable solution for power generation for Sri Lanka. Wewatenna was identified in the Electricity Sector Master Plan Study of Sri Lanka conducted in 2018 as a suitable site. This study develops the basic design configuration and calculates the peaking energy of the proposed PSPP at Wewathenna using the methodologies employed in previous studies conducted in 2015.",
        "The proposed Wewathenna project uses existing Victoria reservoir as the lower pond. The catchment area of the existing “Victoria” is 6.64 km2 and to construct an artificial dam on the eastern side of Victoria Lake serving as the upper pond of capacity 0.33 km2. The net head and maximum discharge are planned as 686 m and 240 m3/s respectively, with a potential capacity of 1,400 MW. However, due to various restrictions, Wewatenna was based on 500 MW. But adhering to manufacturing limit of pump-turbines, the unit capacity was set at 350 MW.",
        "The regulator PUCSL requested CEB a revised plan for tariff reduction starting 1 January 2025, and set a deadline for submission by 6 December 2024. But CEB refused any reductions of rates, claiming excess water in reservoir need to be saved to cater till April, end of dry period. Failure will require power generation through oil and coal.",
        "Former PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake added that the generation cost of electricity has decreased from Rs. 50 to Rs. 28, and electricity tariffs should be reduced by at least 30% passing relief to the public. The consumers have noted that recent heavy rains have significantly boosted hydropower generation and would allow reduction of electricity charges.",
        "Meanwhile, CEB unions called for bonuses, highlighting that the CEB recorded a profit of Rs. 43 billion in 2023 and Rs. 161 billion in 2024. But CEB rejected the demand for bonus. Also no reduction in electricity prices during the next six months, due to lack of low cost energy sources.",
        "The country has almost exhausted its cheapest power hydro-electricity. Only possibility is major movement towards solar power, especially by small and medium scale industries and house owners. Most convenient new solar users would be factories and offices, who normally work during day-light hours. Also, most schools have fans in the classrooms. They could install solar panels on the roofs, eliminating electricity bills. The parents who installed the fans in classrooms could also install solar panels.",
        "Meanwhile, it was reported that Orion City, the nation’s premier IT and business park has invested in a 700 kW solar power at its Colombo 9 complex, ensuring 24/7 uninterrupted power supply to its customers, would be an example to others.",
        "Thus, the Government needs to submit a plan to encourage installation of solar power by individual homes and the industry, with reduced interest loans from commercial banks. Recently, delegates from Japan and Qatar met the President and have offered assistance for renewable energy. Also, a number of European countries have offered low interest loans for renewable power. If the Government takes initiative to get their assistance, new solar investors could be offered low interest loans, will be a great support to the new investors, and will improve the solar power industry and the country."

        "If I had made this statement a few years ago, I would have been labeled insane. The ground reality at that time would have clearly supported that view. But much has changed since then. The basic resources available are natural renewable resources such as sunshine, wind, water. Of particular interest are the solar energy technologies, which have now made it possible for electricity consumers to become “Prosumers”.",
        "The electricity tariff reduction has come as some relief to consumers. However, it was only temporary respite. What was achieved was the removal of the 18% average increase in tariff imposed in October 2023. But the consumers are required to bear two massive tariff increases imposed in August 2022 and February 2023. They would make Sri Lanka’s consumer tariff the highest in the region. The PUCSL has called submissions for the next tariff revision due in June.",
        "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) claims that it has to be paid an adequate tariff to cover its costs, but it does not admit the fact that it has not striven to keep such costs at economical levels in keeping with its mandate.",
        "The reduction of 22% was achieved only because of last year’s abundant rainfall, which enabled the CEB to do without most expensive oil-based generation. (See graph 1)",
        "On 01 Jan., 2024 the use of oil came down to 2%. It was zero on some days. We should try to maintain that but it has now completely reversed as shown below. The oil-based generation has increased to 24% and Coal to 44%. (See Graph 2)",
        "With the reduced contribution from hydro resources, the cost of generation is bound to rise to the previous level. The CEB has already asked for 100 MW of emergency power, which will prompt it to seek further increases in tariff, sooner than later. We are back to square one.",
        "Therefore, an alternative pathway is essential. Perhaps, Sri Lanka can find dollars to buy oil and coal only because we are yet to commence repaying some of our externa debt. The government should take urgent measures to address this situation.",
        "The highest tariff in the region has gravely affected the competitiveness of our exports of manufactured goods and is delaying the possible economic recovery. Hundreds of SMEs may not recover at all.",
        "Rains helped improve the finances of the CEB, enabling it to mitigate some of these negative impacts, but care should be exercised to avoid the past mistakes which led to the recent mess. Its overdependence on fossil fuel, oil in particular, is the main reason for trouble in the past.",
        "The generation data for recent months clearly show that it is possible to do without any thermal generation if the slack is taken up by hydro and other renewables. This can be extended to the dry months too, if other measures are in place to cater to the reduced contribution from hydro generation. The impact of this in a practical way as a step by step process is illustrated below using data presented by the CEB. (See Tables 1 and 2)",
        "But I believe that all these steps, stopping all oil based IPPs, followed by two stage reduction of CEB oil-based power generation, can be achieved within 2024, given the dire consequences of none commitment.",
        "And once this is achieved there would be a further possibility of further tariff reduction by January 2025. What is more important is that there will be no need to increase the tariff.",
        "It may be argued that we have to maintain some oil-based plants to cater to the variability of solar and wind power. But battery technologies are now commercial and continue to be coming down in price. They will be a far cheaper and more efficient solution.",
        "The hitherto ignored promotion of the demand side management (DSM), particularly the savings possible with use of LED bulbs and energy efficient motors can add to this saving as well as the need for more centralized power generation.",
        "This is the challenge I posed at the outset. Let us consumers more correctly “Prosumers” claim our right and accept the challenge. The experience of the past few years has given us the confidence that this is indeed possible. We have to be thankful to the Ministry and the CEB for providing a viable tariff for the rooftop solar PV and making several important concessions on the permitted scope to enable the “Prosumers” to raise their interest and scope of engagement to take up this challenge with confidence.",
        "The current 825 MW of roof top solar contributing 1200 GWh (about 6%) of energy annually is evidence enough. There is a need for national policies and the country’s needs should be recognised by the CEB and LECO staff at the field level and they have to be much more committed and co-operative than at present to assist in this nationally critical endeavour.",
        "There is much discussions going on regarding large solar and wind projects, some of which are given to foreigners on a platter with scant regard for the prevailing laws and regulations. But none of these will make a contribution towards resolving the immediate crisis, as they will not deliver any energy for several years more; they will only block Sri Lankan developers’ access to the grid.",
        "However, the immediate potential and challenge is for highly accelerated development of the rooftop solar PV sector, which currently has several positive drivers to attract investment by a large spectrum of “Prosumers” as noted below:",
        "Well-established and tested regulations under the Surya Bala Sangraamaya Much-widened scope of capacities for investment Current reduced prices of systems supported by appreciated rupee",
        "Large number of competent local EPC Contractors Interest evinced by even domestic sector consumers driven by the significantly high electricity bills Lowered loan interest and increasing engagement of local banking sector Attractive business case possible under the Net Accounting system even for medium level domestic consumers.",
        "(The author will be happy to share the financial analysis on the different modes of engagement possible)",
        "The estimated contribution needed for elimination of use of oil-based generation which is estimated to provide 3440 GWH for the year 2024 are: (See Table 3)",
        "Given the demonstrated progress none of these are impossible targets, and are primarily driven by local private investments, which, while being of value to the investors themselves, would also yield immeasurable benefits to the electricity Sector and the lower end consumers, by lowering the average cost of generation. (See graph 3)",
        "The projected acceleration from 2024 is eminently feasible given the correct emphasis and urgency.",
        "The important message I would like to convey is that it is time we, the true owners of our energy resources, commenced staking our claim which is demonstrably feasible. We will not only be protecting our own interest and wellbeing but also be helping the country immensely. The double benefit of increased “Prosumer” contribution is the reduction of demand on the grid and the need for the projected level of additional generation capacity even from RE sources.",
        "There is absolutely no excuse for the CEB not to initiate a very aggressive DSM programme starting with the replacement of all remaining incandescent bulbs and CFL bulbs with LED bulbs.",
        "There are many other avenues of DSM which require urgent action to implement.",
        "They can do so by refraining from causing obstructions if they are not willing or able to facilitate and accelerate this change in addition to:",
        "Doing away with disincentives like the recent VAT on import of solar panels",
        "Making it the mandatory for the CEB and LECO to ensure reaching the 70% RE target by 2030. This change must have year-by-year milestones and rooftop solar power is the low hanging fruit. Since this can be developed only by the “Prosumers” and not by the CEB nor LECO, it is hoped that they will pass this mandate and responsibility on to the lowest depot level staff, who are best placed to provide the favourable ecosystem to encourage the development Ensuring that banks allocate a reasonable portfolio of credit for the sector without imposing impractical and unfair demands on collateral Maintaining the current favourable fixed feed in tariff (Nov 2022 Gazette) at least until 2026.",
        "Accelerating the process to obtain the next ADB concessional loan facility. While the government keeps stressing the need to increase export income, we can help reduce the outflow of forex.",

        "Newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto announced Indonesia’s largest-ever Cabinet late Sunday, with 109 members representing his pledge for a strong government.",
        "He named his Cabinet of ministers, vice ministers and head of national agencies the “Red and White Cabinet,” referring to the colors of Indonesia’s flag.",
        "Subianto became the eighth president of Southeast Asia’s largest economy on Sunday.",
        "The Cabinet of Subianto’s predecessor, Joko Widodo, had 34 ministers and head of government agencies.",
        "Subianto has said earlier that he needs a strong administration, even though analysts said that his “fat” Cabinet would bloat the bureaucracy.",
        "“I want to create a strong government that would unite our multicultural society and diverse political interests,” Subianto said before inviting more than 100 people for interviews at his residence last week. “It must be a big coalition, and some will say my Cabinet is fat.”",
        "The Cabinet features politicians from a coalition of seven parties who supported his victory in the February election, and figures allied with Widodo’s Cabinet, who were reappointed to continue their jobs under Subianto’s presidency. Analysts said the move was a political reward to Widodo for the latter’s tacit support in the election.",
        "Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo’s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates.",
        "Subianto was a longtime rival of the Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019.",
        "But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president’s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry.",
        "Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February’s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity.",
        "Subianto reappointed nearly half of Widodo’s Cabinet members, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, making her the first person to hold the ministry under three different presidents.",
        "Indrawati, 62, who has served as the executive director of the International Monetary Fund and managing director of the World Bank, is one of Indonesia’s longest-serving finance ministers, having held the post for long stretches under Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo.",
        "She has earned considerable respect in international circles, particularly for her reforms of the chaotic Indonesian taxation system and her role in steering Indonesia through the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "“We regularly consulted with each other to discuss strategies for strengthening the Finance Ministry and the state finances to support his programs,” Indrawati told reporters after meeting with Subianto last week.",
        "Other ministers from Widodo’s Cabinet include Interior Minister Tito Karnavian, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia and State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.",
        "Subianto has announced an ambitious goal of increasing annual economic growth to 8% by the end of his five-year term, and embarking on an ambitious spending program, including an increase in defense spending, hikes in civil servants’ salaries, and a program to give 83 million children free meals."

        "ECONOMYNEXT — Nominations for Sri Lanka’s parliamentary elections will be accepted until 12.30pm on Friday October 11, the Election Commission said.",
        "“Nominations close at noon Friday October 11. Objections will be accepted between 12.30pm to 1.30pm,” Election Commission Chairman R M A L Ratnayake said.",
        "“On this day, after nominations and objections are accepted, no march or gathering is allowed. Police has made special security arrangements,” he added.",
        "“We request supporters of parties and independent groups to refrain from illegal activities after nominations and not to create any problematic situation until the nominees have left the premises.”",
        "Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has signed a gazette notice dissolving parliament, calling elections on November 14.",
        "The Election Commission started accepting nominations on October 04. The new parliament is to meet on November 21.",
        "President Dissanayake was elected with 42 percent of the vote, the first time a president had been elected below 50 percent of the vote.",
        "He had only three members in the current legislature. Following his resignation, another member was appointed to fill his vacancy.",
        "Soon after his election, Dissanayake appointed a cabinet of three, distributing 15 ministries among them.",
        "Sri Lanka’s 1978 constitution introduced a radical departure to the previously existing electoral system and electoral districts. According to parliament.lk, the previous system was based on constituencies with individual candidates nominated by recognised political parties or independent candidates. The candidate obtaining the highest number of votes in respect of the constituency was declared elected. This system, commonly described as the First-past-the-post (FPP) system, was changed in to a system of Proportional Representation in respect of 22 electoral districts.",
        "“The apportionment of the number of members to be returned from each electoral district is made by the Commissioner of Elections in terms of Article 98 (8) of the Constitution. In all, 196 Members of Parliament are returned on the basis of the voting in the respective electoral districts. The 15 th Amendment to the Constitution introduced Article 99A, which provides for 29 members to be declared elected on the basis of the total number of votes polled by the respective political parties or independent groups at the national level (the National List). Thus, we have a proportional system at the district level and a proportional system at the national level based on the same poll.”",
        "In terms of section 99 (6) (a) of the Constitution, a recognised political party or independent group polling less than 1/20 th (5 percent) of the total votes polled within the district is disqualified and the balance valid votes are reckoned for allocation of seats on the basis of the proportional computation.",
        "In each district, parliament.lk notes, the political party or independent group securing the highest number of votes is entitled to have one member declared elected (the Bonus seat). The remaining number of members is declared elected on the basis of the proportion of votes obtained by the political party or the independent group.",
        "“The 14th Amendment to the Constitution introduced a system of preferential voting on the basis of which, the particular candidates to be returned from within each political party or independent group is determined. Each voter is entitled to indicate his\\her preference within the list of candidates of the political party or group to which the vote is cast. Three such preferences could be indicated on the basis of the number assigned to a particular candidate after the nomination paper is accepted by the Returning Officer. The counting of preference votes takes place at the second stage of the counting process in order to determine the particular candidates who would be declared elected from within each political party or independent group.” (Colombo/Oct08/2024)"

      "original_title": "Exponential Growth Of BJP In Tamil Nadu In Five Years (2019 – 2024)",
      "original_body_lines": [
        "“Precise dates, picturesque outbreaks; these are conventions and conveniences of historians but history is a process too subtle for such methods.” – Lord Acton",
        "To many a student of history the above quote is a truism. Keen observers of recent times too would admit to its exactitude. There is a qualification however. Every historic event has had a fair period filled with  long gestating antecedents. French Revolution did not explode just on 14th July 1789. German nationalism grew up with philosopher Fichte’s ‘Addresses to the German Nation’ after 1812. What followed was Bismark’s ideology of ‘Blood and Iron’ which unified Germany with wars in the sixties. Likewise, the Russian and Chinese revolutions had their protracted struggles.",
        "India too has had her decades long struggle for independence though the ethos was non-violent. Independence mandated speedy growth in the economic and social spheres in consolidating the fruits of freedom. This was not to be as seen in the contrast with the astronomic four to five times disparity of development in China. India needs to catch up on a generation of lost time. Tamil Nadu has had the misfortune of a mismatch of talent, resources and performance correctly identified to want of leadership.",
        "Except for brief interventions of clean governance, the much vaunted ‘Dravidian Model’ became a byword for corruption, which in currency terms vaulted to Trillions. At this juncture emerged a doctor with knife in hand bent on surgical intervention. Having already diagnosed the ailment as terminal cancer and having the over-arching support of the polity in the state and the union government at the centre, the DMK is terror stricken. Symptoms manifest in placing interminable impediments in the way of Annamalai’s Pada Yatra, orchestrating blackouts in airports and roads and indulging in other disgraceful misdemeanours. By whom? The very party in governance styling itself a model with an ethnic overtone.",
        "For reasons that were well known, BJP lagged in growth in Tamil Nadu till 2014. In a Germany devastated by the first World War, a leader emerged in the early nineteen twenties. Capacity to Theorize, Organize and Lead were essential attributes identified by that leader. India had the great fortune of leaders of stature in Tilak, Gandhi and Nehru. Thence emerged Vajpaayee from the turn of the century till 2004. The leader to follow in 2014 was of uncommon characteristics blessed with rare capacity for vision and leadership. He was Narendra Modi who is now of world stature and widely recognized as such. He and his party were accepted by India, but till lately not by Tamil Nadu. The picture is changing now and the nation’s Parliament will receive respectable representation in May 2024 from the state BJP.",
        "What explains the change? Emergence into politics of a leader of creditable academic performance, complemented by a decade of commendable government service. I discern that he has devoted a quarter century of preparation, principally reading in a very wide area related to politics and governance. His facility at multi-lingual oratory to mass audiences as well as to academic groups is a rare accomplishment. He is already treated as a pearl of great price to Tamil Nadu and a valued leader to India.",
        "Many an attribute that a leader should possess, he has in good measure. Above them all is animated participation in Pada Yatras and total involvement in listenership and assimilation of his followers. With what result? For full 7 months, the polity has marched with him imbibing the leader’s mind, spirit and message to transform over millions of the voting multitude. They have had enough animation for interaction and regurgitation and look forward to greater involvement in larger numbers in the voting process. Having traversed a fair stretch of populated territory in the electorates and experienced the voter’s warm response, the BJP bristles with confidence.",
        "After the Kamaraj era in Tamil Nadu and the MGR regimes, hardly ever has a DMK or AIADMK had successive terms in the seat of government. The state was rife with corruption and both parties earned the disregard of the electorate. When neither party could secure power on its own credentials, ‘purchase of votes’ became the abominable feature at elections over decades. In no time, alliances with other parties became inevitable. For almost half a century this evil is a mandated norm. A study of party affiliations shows a practice comparable only to the doping of horses at the racecourse. The worst evil now is for parties to piggy back on the prospective winners, bargain for seats in the legislature and even places in the Rajya Sabha. Whom did the framers of the constitution have in mind for RS? Personages of the calibre of Dr. M S Swaminathan, S. Jayshankar or Nirmala Sitaraman.",
        "By 1991, the succession of a single National Party dominating the state at a General Election had become a phenomenon of the past throughout all the states. In Tamil Nadu, this change started in 1967 and has continued ever since for 57 years. For all appearances two state parties – DMK and AIADMK stole the show. However what was conspicuous was only the knitting together of coalitions. The minor state parties had no alternative but to sharpen their bargaining tactics and to piggy back on a leading party. Their incremental addition to voter strength made some difference. It has however been only a fleeting change as in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019. The inability to finalize the party alliance for the 2024 encounter is proof that without other party support, no formation is strong enough to sail to success on its own.",
        "Professing to redeeming the Tamils from a supposed Aryan onslaught, a coterie of people came together to have a political formation of their own. Hunting for a leader they struck upon a non-Tamil whom they reverentially called Periyar to lead the Tamils. In a discussion on what name to adopt, he confessed that he was not a Tamil but a Dravidian from Karnataka. His place of birth was not Tami Nadu and his Mother Tongue was Kannada. For all these reasons he wanted the name Dravidian.",
        "He hated the Tamils, despised their language and knew nothing about their culture or history. He reviled everything Tamil and reveled in hating Thirukkural. In no time CN Annadurai found that he and his comperes had no political future with a maniac. Therefore he founded the DMK in 1949 a misnomer for a principally Tamil state. To cut any ice it took him and his party 18 years and he won in 1967. It took only 3 years for his successor’s government to be dismissed for corruption by Indira Gandhi. Soon thereafter MGR revolted against his corruption and the party’s brutal attack on dissenters and launched his party AIADMK. Both DMK and AIDMK were cast in the same mint. It didn’t take long after MGR’s demise for the two parties to vie with each other for superseding in corruption and to draw the state into mud and disrepute.",
        "The complexity of the challenge and the difficulty in resolution are best known to Annamalai and his mentors in Delhi. Seeking to graft a large measure of idealism in an India of rich credentials and yet tainted by grotesque failings is Annamalai’s principal challenge. The image that has already got built up and that too with an all-India flavour is too much of a burden to bear.",
        "To his credit may be cited his commendable success so far. Millions in Tamil Nadu bear personal testimony to his sagacity and relentless conveyance of BJP’s ideals, achievements and future programmes. In 111 days of Padayatra traversing through all 234 electorates, he has enlightened the polity of Tamil Nadu through his educative discourses enlivened with authentic facts and credible statistics. The whole course was accomplished in 7 months from July 28 to February 27, 2024. Shallow taunts of his opponents made hitherto became unconvincing and were shattered to smithereens. Two long months are yet available for a well integrated party to galvanize itself to victory,",
        "At no time in a political event in Tamil Nadu has the state seen a vaster assemblage. What explains? The sequence of events since the state election of 2021, has stirred up the political consciousness of the state as never before. The gathering crowds escalating with every Padayatra unnerved the challengers of Annamalai. The disintegration of party alliances opposed to the BJP, is now in full swing. The patch work I.N.D.I.A. is already in tatters.",
        "Following the demise of Nehru and the premature death of Indira Gandhi, there was no political personality of towering strength. Any credible political philosophy with a viable economic programme ceased to evolve. At the turn of the 21st century, it was not difficult for Atal Bihari Vaajpaaye to become the able helmsman of the second largest nation on the globe. The next term of Congress was creditable and after the second one, the Congress sang its Swan song.",
        "Thereafter came into focus Narendra Modi in 2014 and he is steering his visionary path to a sure Third Term from 2024. Annamalai leading the BJP in Tamil Nadu is endeavouring to scale new heights in Tamil Nadu as his contribution to Modi’s remarkable success."

        "Leaving the argumentation part to the more qualified legal profession I intend to set out below the issues concerning the matter about which there is a growing strong dispute debated in public and the media.",
        "a. A Bill for the amendment or for the repeal and replacement of or which is inconsistent with any of the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 or of this Article, and",
        "b. A Bill for the amendment or for the repeal and replacement of or which is inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 30 or of paragraph (2)of Article 62 which would extend the term of office of the President or the duration of Parliament, as the case may be, to over six years,",
        "c. Shall become law if the number of votes cast in favour thereof amounts to not less than two thirds of the whole number of members (including those not present), is approved by the People at a Referendum and a certificate is endorsed thereon by the President in accordance with Article 80.",
        "Article 80 provides how a Bill passed by Parliament shall become Law;",
        "(2) Where the Cabinet of Ministers has certified that any Bill or any provision thereof is intended to be submitted for approval by the people at a Referendum or where the Supreme Court has determined that a Bill or any provision thereof requires the approval of the people at a Referendum under para (2) of Article 85, (article dealing with Referendums), such a Bill or such provision shall become law upon being approved by the People at a Referendum in accordance with paragraph (3) of Article 85 only when the President certifies that the Bill or provision thereof has been so approved.",
        "(3) Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground whatsoever.",
        "The impugned Article 30 which has become the centre of a debate today, in the 1978 constitution read as follows;",
        "30 (2) The President of the Republic shall be elected by the people, and shall hold office for a term of six years.",
        "Article 30 of the Constitution is hereby repealed and the following Article substituted therefor: -",
        "30(1) There shall be a President of the Republic of Sri Lanka, who is the Head of the State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.",
        "(2)The President of the Republic shall be elected by the People and shall hold office for a term of five years {emphasis by the writer}.",
        "Now in terms of the 1978 Constitution, there appears to be a further constitutional compliance needed for this amendment to become a Law under the above quoted Article 83 which specifically stipulates need for an approval of any amendment to Article 30(2) by the people at a Referendum.",
        "In the amended 19th Constitution we see the Article 30(2) has been amended to read as the, “elected president shall hold office for a term of five years”, but the people did not get an opportunity to approve this reduction of the term period from the original 6 years to 5 years as citizens entitled to a vote, at a Referendum.",
        "In such a context some People will conclude that this amendment is invalid in Law. Hence the commotion. Any variation of the term given in the Constitution amounts to a replacement to the original decision. Article 83 (b) requires any such replacement to be approved by the people at a referendum.",
        "This confusion is worse confounded due to the President stating that it is a mistake for which he wishes to tender an apology. He also inferred that those to whom he entrusted the constitutional amendment were inept and incapable of delivering things right.",
        "Now there is a new Bill before the Parliament which is worded as follows:",
        "A Bill to amend the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka",
        "An Act to amend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka",
        "Be it enacted by the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka as follows:-",
        "1. This Act may be cited as the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution.",
        "2. Article 83 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is hereby amended in paragraph (b) thereof, by the substitution for the words “to over six years” of the words “to over five years”.",
        "3. In the event of any inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of this Act, the Sinhala text shall prevail.  ……",
        "The million dollar question is will this not cause another hornets’ nest adding to the quandary. Substitution of the words, “to over five years” replacing “to over six years” is yet another amendment replacing the original provision giving an entirely different version amounting to a complete change. Article 83 (b) does not make a distinction whether the change is for an increase or decrease of the anticipated period. If the change is a replacement to the original, it will need the approval of the people at a referendum. So does it mean that the Presidential election has to await the outcome of the Referendum?"

Farmers countrywide have been urging the government to implement a permanent solution to mitigate this issue, Amaraweera explained.",

This year the program aims to distribute 1,000 air rifles across the island.",
